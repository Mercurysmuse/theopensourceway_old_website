<h2 id="_presenting_the_open_source_way">1. Presenting The Open Source Way</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Author: Karsten Wade &lt;<a href="mailto:quaid@iquaid.org">quaid@iquaid.org</a>&gt;
Updated: 2020-10-27</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An English idiom says, "There is a method to my madness.".<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
Most of the time, the things we do make absolutely no sense to outside observers.
They look like sheer madness.
But for those inside that messiness—inside that whirlwind of activity—there&#8217;s a certain regularity, a certain predictability, and a certain motive.
A method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source community management can seem like its own form of incomprehensible madness, especially to someone who&#8217;s unfamiliar with how open source software gets made, or those who find themselves staring down the prospect of having to coordinate others to join in making it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this guide hopes to provide is some insight into an ever-evolving methodology.
What are your preferences for practicing the open source way?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But beyond that, this work is really digging into the question of <em>why</em> someone might do the work this way.
Why use this or that method to organize the madness?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So from this introduction you should take two important points:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>There is a <em>what</em>, a <em>how</em>, and a <em>why</em> to the practice of successfully and sustainably creating and maintaining open source software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guide distills opinions from a sizeable group of open source practitioners, the kind of people always having to answer the question of <em>why we do this open source thing the way we do it</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, this guide is a living document that endeavors to gather and spread a diverse group of voices who are similarly (and somewhat-opinionatedly) collecting the best ways to create and manage an open source software community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These voices are all part of <a href="https://theopensourcway.org">this community of practice around open source software community management</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_shape_of_things_i_e_assumptions_we_are_making">1.1. The shape of things, i.e., assumptions we are making</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you look at the table of contents for this guide, notice how the flow of focus goes from the user, to the participant, to the contributor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This arrangement specifically tracks our view of how a community comes about and grows. And it all starts with a need.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A person or persons needing a solution creates the first iteration of the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other people with similar needs start using it, forming the core of the userbase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the userbase arise people who are enthusiasts of the software and things about/around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually arising from the users and the enthusiasts come people who are interested and have grown capable of contributing to the software in some way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the primary and continual focus for a project is to <em>take good care of your users</em>, for some of them will become your contributors, and you want them to do it out of love more than anger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key element of all this is recognizing the value in contributions of all types, at all levels.
Rather than valorizing only a single type of contribution, the best practice is to treat all manner of gifts to the project as equal.
These contributions comprise content and code, hours and effort, and all manner of broad contributions for the project via events, discussion forums, infrastructure maintenance, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you lower barriers to participation, you make your project welcoming at all levels.
This doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>remove all barriers</em>—just lower most of them appropriately.
Appropriate barriers are necessary for someone receiving keys to systems, for example, and these barriers are different from those allowing only certain participants to contribute a help article or a patch to the configuration management system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_our_core_opinion">1.1.1. Our core opinion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is an opinion at the core of this work, that explains how the content is laid out, how the steps on the path revealed so that you can find yourself wherever you are in your journey of open source practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focus on your end-users and lower the barriers to participation all around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors arise from participants, who all started as users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make your software wildly successful by having a user-centric initiative, while making the community open and welcoming those users come looking to see what is going on the creation/contribution side</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pathway of this guidebook therefore is:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Attract users</strong> to your software because it solves the problems they have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guide participants</strong> who care about open source and sharing good solutions so that they can be effective enthusiasts for your software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grow contributors</strong> from this rich, fertile user and enthusiast base, by making sure when any of those folks look into how the software is made, they see themselves represented and can imagine how they could fit in, too.
Make sure when they get to the contributor party, the barriers are clearly lowered and welcoming.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to let people know about your great dance party.
It&#8217;s another thing to empower those dancers to advocate for your way of throwing a dance party.
It&#8217;s a very great thing to make the dance party able to evolve to welcome all manner of music and dance from the world around us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the dancers who see your poster and show up in the first step to stick around, it helps if they can see right away that this is a place for them and theirs, too.</p>

<p>In considering this pathway, you can see there is no emphasis on expertise or even existing skills relevant to the project more than curiosity and willingness to try the software, to care about the software, and to help create the software.
This does not mean that people don&#8217;t bring skills to the project; they do, many of them right from first point of contact with the project.
But it is easier to teach skills than to teach someone to truly care about your project.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this journey, there are many best practices we recommend, including how to put together a plan for measuring your community&#8217;s progress.
We also list some specific areas to be careful of and watch out for, including a robust discussion on self-care and mental health considerations for community managers themselves.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our best way of more-deeply conveying all this information is with stories.

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction">2.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do people participate in open source communities? What do they get out of it? Are they focused on their own needs, or are they mostly thinking about others?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that people are involved, the answer—as you might guess—is complicated and varied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One need only consider the behaviors we see in open source communities to very quickly intuit that there&#8217;s no single force at work here. After all, we see plenty of contributors on most big open source projects who are doing so at part of their day job. That doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t care about open source beyond a paycheck. But it does suggest different reasons for participation than the contributor working nights and weekends on their own passion project. Furthermore, we see contributors who are focused on solving some interesting technical problems while others are explicitly trying to bring about a societal benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t suss out some common patterns. Not only has there been academic research into open course contributions specifically, but there&#8217;s a whole body of psychology literature dealing with motivation. As a result, motivation is the lens we&#8217;ll use in this chapter to examine the question of why contributors participate in open source.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_extrinsic_motivation">2.2. Extrinsic motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could say that this type of motivator is about "Show me the money!" and leave it at that. Extrinsic motivation isn&#8217;t quite that simple, but payment in whatever form that took during a given era and place has historically been the go-to way to get people to do something. Whether to accumulate riches or provide themselves with basic necessities such as food and shelter. The idea that you do work you otherwise wouldn&#8217;t bother with in exchange for something of value is deep-rooted in most human societies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However obvious the existence of extrinsic motivation may seem to the average person, it wasn&#8217;t really a field of formal study until the 1940s when behaviorist Clark Hull, later working with Kenneth Spence, came up with the idea of drive reduction theory. This theory focused on reducing primary drives like hunger and thirst. If you&#8217;re hungry you eat. If you&#8217;re thirsty you drink. Drive reduction theory fell out of fashion, in part because it <em>didn&#8217;t</em> focus on things—like money—that could be used to reduce drives but only in a secondary way. However, we see echoes of drive reduction theory in familiar concepts like Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coming back to what makes contributors work on open source, money can, of course, be a big carrot. Even going back twenty years or so, many major open source projects had a significant number of contributors who were paid by their companies to work on open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Career advancement goes hand in hand with pay. But is open source software any different from proprietary software development in this regard? It may be. Multiple researchers have found empirical evidence to support the idea that there&#8217;s at least a perceived advantage to support the argument that there are career advantages to developing code that&#8217;s in the open and therefore available for others to look at and work with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More recently, there&#8217;s been significant empirical evidence to support the argument that there are career advantages to developing code and contributing content that&#8217;s in the open and therefore available for others to look at and work with. Indeed, the idea of "GitHub-as-resume" has become a common (if sometimes inappropriately applied) theme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_intrinsic_motivation">2.3. Intrinsic motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research beginning in the 1970s started to focus on intrinsic motivations, which do not require an apparent reward other than the activity itself. Self-Determination Theory, developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, would later evolve from studies comparing intrinsic and extrinsic motives, and from a growing understanding of the dominant role intrinsic motivations can play in behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With respect to open source software, it&#8217;s perhaps the ideological or altruistic motivations that first come to mind here. After all, in the case of free software at least, there was always an ideological and political element from the beginning even if there were also practical benefits for a user to have access to source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s some evidence from surveys that contributors can be somewhat motivated by these factors. However, the research results are mixed. Some contributors say on surveys that they&#8217;re participating, in part, for ideological or altruistic reasons. But the effect is most pronounced among contributors doing open source as a hobby. And while altruism certainly can influence professional contributors, this mostly seems to be the case among contributors who are <em>also</em> satisfied with their pay and other aspects of their career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variant of altruism is kinship amity. It&#8217;s related to the concept of gift economies but is specific to family (kin) groups which don&#8217;t expect a calculated <em>quid pro quo</em>. (In other words, family members do things for each other but they don&#8217;t typically keep a running tally, at least a systematic one, of who hasn&#8217;t been pulling their weight recently.) It&#8217;s different from altruism in that it is restricted to the group to which one belongs, such as an open source community. Here again the research is mixed. Studies have generally found a positive relationship between identified kinship amity and various measurements of effort, such as number of hours worked per week—but the correlation is often fairly weak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s just fun. This should come as no surprise to anyone who hangs around open source developers, designers, and content creators. Most of them <em>like</em> working on open source projects. One large study from 2007 (Luthiger and Jungwirth) determined that fun accounted for 28 percent of the effort (hours) dedicated to projects. Though, again, it&#8217;s easier to feel motivated by fun and altruism when it&#8217;s either a hobby or you&#8217;re otherwise satisfied professionally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_internalized_extrinsic_motivation">2.4. Internalized extrinsic motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s psychology literature also includes the idea of internalized extrinsic motivations. These are extrinsic motivations such as gaining skills to enhance career opportunities—but they&#8217;ve been internalized so that the motivation comes from within rather than coming as a direct result of a carrot being dangled by someone else. It&#8217;s the difference between learning a new language because you know keeping current on new tech pays off over time versus receiving a salary increase as a direct payoff for earning a certification. Gaining a good peer reputation, among community insiders and potential employers, for work in open source is one good example of how this type of motivation can play out in open source development. A variety of surveys have supported the idea that peer reputation is a driver for participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning is also frequently mentioned as a big benefit to participating in open source projects. Learning may be intrinsically satisfying but it can also be an important ingredient of career advancement. It can be hard to tease apart the intrinsic from the extrinsic here though.
Is it learning for learning&#8217;s sake? Is it learning for specific skills needed on the job?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A final motivator in this category is what researchers call "own-use value" but is more recognizably described as something like "scratch your own itch." Develop something that you want for yourself and create something for others in the process. That something is ultimately an external reward to yourself but no one is forcing you to do it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion">2.5. Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted earlier, motivations for many things are multi-faceted and contributing to open source software is no exception. However, here are three takeaways that you may find useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t expect non-extrinsic motivators to carry too much of the load.</strong> Many do contribute to open source projects for idealistic or altruistic reasons. But those are usually not the sole motivators and may not even be an important ones. Especially in the case of projects that have commercial backing, pay, and other professional working benefits matter a great deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Ampily non-extrinsic motivators such as learning and peer recognition.</strong> While not replacements for more direct benefits, the opportunity to be recognized by peers and to work in new technology areas are motivators. Organizations should consider peer recognition programs and explicitly encourage learning in order to make the best use of these motivational factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Motivators can be counter-productive when over-rotated.</strong> Precisely because motivations are multi-faceted, don&#8217;t place too big a bet on any single one. We already discussed the limitations of ideology and altruism. However, also consider something like "scratch your own itch" for example. If that&#8217;s the <em>only</em> someone contributes, they&#8217;ll tend to wander in and out of a project as their own specific needs merit. That may be a perfectly fine outcome, but it&#8217;s not a path to developing a long-term maintainer.</p>

<h2 id="_communication_norms_in_open_source_software_projects">3. Communication norms in open source software projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction_2">3.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the tools projects use to communicate continually evolve, best practices for communicating among project participants rarely change.
This chapter will cover the basics of project communications and offer advice on serving a global audience by making the best use of particular tools and platforms.
We&#8217;ll see how certain norms and techniques for maintaining productive communication in your community will ring true everywhere, regardless of the communication tools or platforms a project chooses.
And we will conclude with some observations on the ways ever-changing tooling and communication practices in open source projects may present challenges for the outside observer—particularly academic researchers—along with recommendations for mitigating those challenges in a way that benefits all project participants.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_evolution_of_communication_platforms_in_free_and_opensource_software_projects">3.2. The evolution of communication platforms in free and opensource software projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the number of free and open source software projects has increased over time, the communication tools projects use—both to connect with their users and to coordinate their developers and contributors—have evolved.
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was once the default choice for real-time project chat.
Many large projects conducted development discussions solely via their electronic mailing lists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecode">Freshmeat</a> was the place to hear about new project releases or updates to existing projects, and discussions about feature design and project improvements occurred via email and were included in a project&#8217;s mailing list archives.
PD&#8212;&#8203;The sentence in line 14 is quite long. Consider breaking into two sentences (most likely between "projects" and "discussion").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, the landscape has shifted:
PD&#8212;&#8203;The bullets that follow are quite long. Consider either paring them down so they are the length of one to two relatively simple sentences or reformat into paragraphs.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>While real-time chat is perhaps less common today, projects have not forgone it entirely.
Many projects have simply adopted services that are considered more user-friendly or accessible to those who may not know how to attach to a screen session in Irssi in order to have a persistent connection to their chat system (for example, Gitter, Slack, RocketChat, and others).
PD&#8212;&#8203;Admittedly, I&#8217;m not the most tech-savvy person you&#8217;ll find, but I had a hard time following the sentence above. Can it be simplified?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While some communities still employ email for asynchronous communications, others have found they can achieve better results by offering their users the opportunity to collaborate in online forums, a format more familiar to many developers who began coding at the same time they were sharing news and perspectives on then-new and popular forum sites like Reddit and Imgur.
Advocates of the use of forums find the visual layout more appealing, and forum administrators often prefer the medium&#8217;s fine grained access controls easier to use for moderation. (For example, being able to stop all posts in a particular thread during a heated discussion is relatively easy via most forum software—not so with mailing lists.)
PD&#8212;&#8203;How would you feel about "Forum advocates" instead of "Advocates of the use of forums"? It&#8217;s a little tighter. It is also parallel with "forum advocates" later in the sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Freshmeat remains active (now renamed to Freecode), free and open source software projects have also made extensive use of social media services like Twitter and Facebook to interact with their user and developer communities.
Obviously, social media serves as an excellent vehicle for project marketing and keeping audiences abreast of major project developments.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Consider deleting "Obviously" as not everyone in the audience might have that feeling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Social media also provides a vehicle for advertising upcoming events, live streaming of content or talks, generating interest in a project, and other forms of marketing and outreach that broadcast further than a project&#8217;s newsletter, website, or blog.
PD&#8212;&#8203;This sentence would be a good candidate for a bulleted list. Doing so would better ensure social media&#8217;s capabilities aren&#8217;t lost within the body of the paragraph. However, it would be better if you didn&#8217;t have a list within a list, which gets back to the original comment about the bullets in this list being rather long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And many users now expect to receive basic technical support via these platforms.
* While mailing list archives may no longer serve as a definitive record of project discussions, <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s popularity as an online development and collaboration platform, has meant many projects now manage their development discussions via GitHub issues, using GitHub&#8217;s "tags" feature to differentiate, for instance, between discussions addressing implementation of a new feature and those reporting that the software does not work as intended.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Would it be possible to break this sentence up into more manageable chunks for the reader?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet while the tools free and open source projects use to achieve communication are rapidly evolving, the human needs for both information and a sense of connection have not changed.</p>

<li>
<p>Build a sense of common interest and purpose amongst participants, and provide an outlet for people in the project to socialize or "hang out" together online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a location for contributors to the project to collaboratively work together, be it on documentation for the project or to discuss how a particular part of the code base should be refactored.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_know_your_audiences">3.3.2. Know your audience(s)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you develop project documentation and other informational resources, recognize this work has several different audiences.
Understanding these audiences and prioritizing their unique needs can help you craft better materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, consider the basic distinction between project <em>users</em> and project <em>developers</em>.
Someone interested in <em>using</em> the software will be interested in things like how to install it, how to configure it, and what they need to know to accomplish the task at hand (e.g., build a website).
Developers will also be interested in such details, but will need <em>additional</em> detail if they are going to contribute effectively to the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if your project observes certain coding conventions, be sure to include those conventions in the developer documentation.
PD&#8212;&#8203;You&#8217;ve got two paragraphs that both begin with "For example." Consider omitting one instance or using a synonym for variety&#8217;s sake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having a patch rejected by a maintainer because you haven&#8217;t indented code a certain way can be rather demotivating. Users, however, likely won&#8217;t need these details.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When people are looking for information about software that may help them solve a problem, their first stop will likely be the project website.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project website needn&#8217;t be intricately designed to be effective (though a more attractive site aids with project marketing).
A thorough README.md file on GitHub can work well as a project website, provided the information it offers gives users and potential contributors a sufficient overview of the project.
A basic project website should feature at least the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_project_overview">3.4.1. Project overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Include a simple overview of the project in an easy-to-spot location on the project website.
This project description should include what the code base is designed to do and what problems someone might solve by using it.
Making this information succinct and easy to find is critical.

<h4 id="_getting_started">3.4.2. Getting started</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processes for creating good "getting started" documentation—occasionally called "onboarding documentation"—are outside the scope of this chapter.
PD&#8212;&#8203;A general observation here: There are several em dashes in this paragraph (and the chapter as a whole). I love em dashes. They are my favorite punctuation mark. However, when used too often, their effectiveness is diluted. Consider replacing them with other punctuation throughout the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(See the dedicated "Onboarding" section in this guidebook for more detail.)
Here, suffice it to say that open source project websites should feature a section aimed at helping new users and potential contributors get started using the software.
Clearly labeling that section "getting started" or "new users" makes finding that section easy when people need it.
Further differentiating between "new users" and "new contributors" in your onboarding documentation is even better, as these two audiences have very different needs.
Clearly pointing to these resources for newcomers on the project website helps to keep the project&#8217;s other communication channels—like the forums and real-time chat rooms—free from frequently repeated inquiries about how to get started.</p>

<h4 id="_frequently_asked_questions">3.4.3. Frequently asked questions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another excellent location to feature basic information about your project is a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page.
If project development is just beginning, a basic FAQ detailing what the project is, what the code base is used for, and how someone can get access to the code is sufficient.
However, as more people join the project—new users, developers, documentarians, etc.—you will likely find yourself answering the same basic questions repeatedly.
(And in the process you&#8217;ll discover that many aspects of the projects are not as obvious to newcomers as they are to you.)
These repeat questions represent opportunities to improve your documentation and to seek help from your community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep your FAQ updated and easy to locate.
But even better: Ask community participants to help you improve it.
When answering a question for a newcomer, be it via email on the project mailing list or in real-time chat, ask the newcomer to write up the question and answer for inclusion in the project FAQ.
By asking for help from your community, you do several things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Get help keeping your documentation relevant and timely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate that community contributions to the project are welcome and encouraged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite further contribution from someone who has already shown interest in the project by asking for their help.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, newcomers would have the ability to edit the FAQ themselves.
Sending instructions for how to edit the FAQ along with your request to contribute to it—thus lowering the barrier to entry—makes receiving a contribution more likely.
If your project maintains a contributors list, make sure to include the people contributing to your FAQ in it.
People love seeing their work and contributions (however small) acknowledged.
Doing so gives contributors a sense of belonging and commitment to the project.
People who feel their work is appreciated and respected are more likely to stick around and contribute to the project, whether by filing issues or adding new features.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_document_project_goals_and_non_goals">3.4.4. Document project goals and non-goals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your project&#8217;s website should also make clear the <em>purpose</em> of the project and the <em>activities</em> the project has as its focus.
People have difficulty understanding how they can best fit into a community and how they can contribute if they do not understand what activities are currently in progress and what is planned for the future.
One common tool to communicate these goals is a project roadmap.
Even if your project does not yet have sufficient resources to develop this kind of roadmap, you should still find some way to ensure users and would-be contributors understand the project landscape.
For instance, a weekly recap of project activities and planned activities for the coming week or month is an excellent start, and it&#8217;s something you can offer through a quick blog or forum post.
Such works are an excellent resource for newcomers orienting themselves to the project and are a wonderful place to point interested parties to learn more as part of their onboarding process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communicating your project&#8217;s <em>non-goals</em> is equally important.
Due to the vibrant nature of open source projects, it is only natural that someone will find a use for a project that the project&#8217;s creators never intended and will wish to extend the project&#8217;s capabilities to target that specific use case.
If the project maintainers do not intend for the project to have a wider focus than what is already offered, letting these would-be contributors know this in advance will save everyone time and disappointment.
In the era of "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)[easy forking]," it is relatively easy for those who would use some parts of the project but not others to develop and maintain a code base that better matches their own needs—all without asking the maintainers of the original project to deviate from their intended vision and the project scope they&#8217;ve set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documenting non-goals is also particularly important for commercially focused projects, where a contributor&#8217;s desire to create a feature as open source may be in conflict with vendor goals for creating proprietary features.
Contributors may still choose to create that feature as open source, but they should know from the start that upstream maintainers do not intend to include their work as part of the project&#8217;s code base.
Some may choose to not implement the feature, knowing that a vendor is creating it for them; still others may choose not to implement the feature if they know it will not be included in the project&#8217;s mainline source tree, as they do not wish to incur the burden of ongoing maintenance themselves.
And others may choose to go ahead and create something that works well for them and release it as open source, regardless of whether the feature is incorporated into the project&#8217;s main source repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most important here is that no one feels <em>surprised</em> by the direction a project will take.
No project needs to accept every contribution, but having contributors invest time and energy into developing something only to discover it will not be accepted due to a conflict with an unknown roadmap (commercial or otherwise) creates tension in the community and a lack of trust in the project maintainers.
It can even encourage adoption of open source alternatives to the vendor&#8217;s product.</p>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>=== What is an issue tracker?</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An issue tracker (sometimes also known as a "bug tracker, "issues list," or "issue queue") is a tool that allows people to submit reports when they encounter instances where they believe the software is not working as intended.footnote:[The authors are grateful for the work of Kent C.Dodds a
Some projects manage their entire development workflow via their issue trackers as a way to monitor pending tasks and allow for collaborative commenting and review of work in progress.
PD&#8212;&#8203;You may want to flip flop the order of the sentence here and begin with "As a way to monitor &#8230;&#8203;" to give more emphasis to the motivation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll discuss using an issue tracker for the purpose of reporting failures with the software.
By reporting your issue using a project&#8217;s issue tracker, you ensure maintainers who are looking out for problems see your report and act upon it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_why_file_an_issue">3.5.1. Why file an issue?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While filing an issue may seem more cumbersome than simply asking for help in real-time chat, it is important to do for several reasons:
PD&#8212;&#8203;Some of the bullets in this list are also quite long. Can you pare down the content so they&#8217;re shorter? Or consider a different presentation (paragraphs/subheads)?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Project contributors cannot keep track of all conversations occurring across various platforms, but they can always refer back to the issue tracker when they have an opportunity to work on improving the project.
PD-With an eye toward paring down content, maybe change to "&#8230;&#8203; but they can always refer to the issue tracker to improve the project."?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Real-time chat and social media are ephemeral communication channels.
The issue tracker is a purpose built tool for recording and reviewing problems with the software.
* Software projects often define their upcoming work plans by using their issue tracker as a key component—and perhaps their sole tool—to prioritize all possible areas to work on.
(Simply put, the project&#8217;s issue tracker is very often synonymous with the project&#8217;s to-do list.)
If your problem does not make its way into the issue tracker, it will likely not be addressed simply because a very busy person has forgotten the details of the problem.
For this reason, you will often find that one of the first requests you receive when asking for help is to file an issue so the project maintainers can keep track of the problem.
* Filing an issue allows you and the project contributors to communicate asynchronously about the problem in an easy way, as all parties can refer back to and access the issue description and follow up comments at any time.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Be careful about using "easy" as what&#8217;s easy for you may not be easy for your reader. It&#8217;s subjective and can come across as an absolute. Try to soften by making it more relative.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you&#8217;ve uncovered a problem with the software, you might discover that the problem is actually the root cause of <em>another</em> problem, or there may be a way in which <em>several</em> problems are related.
Issue tracking software allows project developers to easily group related issues together, which may aid in diagnosing a problem&#8217;s root cause.
PD&#8212;&#8203;See comment above about "easy" and carry through with "easily."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People often encounter the same issues with software, and many of them are filing issues with the project.
Having multiple reports of the same problem can be very time consuming for the project maintainers, as they then need to respond to each individual reporter about work in progress.
Fortunately, issue trackers make this process easier by allowing maintainers to quickly and easily close issues by stating they&#8217;re duplicates of an existing one (and then asking the reporter to track work-in-progress in the "original" report).
PD&#8212;&#8203;Additional instances of "easy" and "easily" to consider.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project maintainers can then engage in broadcast-style communication to everyone experiencing the problem in one place, simplifying their work stream while still helping everyone who needs assistance.

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_make_finding_it_easy">3.5.2. Make finding it easy</h4>

<p>PD&#8212;&#8203;Reference earlier comments about "easy." Also, does "it" refer to "issue"? If so, it may be too far from the antecedent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure the location of your project&#8217;s issue tracker is prominently displayed in your FAQ, as well as in your usage and development documentation.
If people cannot figure out where to submit an issue, they will ask someone in the project where to do so—and supporting well-meaning users by offering repeated answers to very basic questions like this one can be quite time consuming.
PD&#8212;&#8203;A longish sentence. Maybe break into multiple ones so it&#8217;s easier for the reader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do yourself and your community a favor and make your issue tracker very easy to find!.
==== Use issue templates</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not everyone who uses your software will be familiar with your community&#8217;s conventions for filing a useful bug report.
To save both you and the reporter time, offer an issue template to ensure you receive the information you need to reproduce the reported error and effectively triage it.
PD&#8212;&#8203;My non-technical background caused me to pause on "reporter" as I immediately thought of a journalist. Maybe recast the sentence to "To save everyone time" or "To save time" instead?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you may need to know what version of the software was in use when an error occurred, or what operating system the user has on the computer running the software.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Maybe "&#8230;&#8203; what version of the software or what operating system was being used" instead?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If common information is required for reproducing errors, ask for it in an issue template.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Common fields in issue templates include a summary of the issue, steps to reproduce it, the actual behavior the user observes, the intended behavior for the software, and a request for log files or screenshots to help guide the issue reviewer in better understanding the bug report.
Several issue trackers support templates for bug reports, including <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_issue_templates">Redmine</a>, and <a href="https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracTicketTemplatePlugin">Trac</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_help_wanted_labeling_issues_for_clarity_and_encouraging_contribution">3.5.3. Help wanted: Labeling issues for clarity and encouraging contribution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most modern issue trackers allow users to label issues they file, which can be useful for organizing project work.
By differentiating between different types of requests—features for development, software errors, etc.—a project can be more organized and triage issues more efficiently.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Question the use of "project" as the subject for the second verb as a "project" can&#8217;t technically "triage issues," but people can.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further, many people interested in contributing to open source software projects are looking for issues on which they can work to better understand the project&#8217;s development mechanics.
If you will actively use labels in your issue tracker, make sure to document the label definitions in your development documentation so those labels are used consistently (or restrict the addition of issue labels to project maintainers only).
A list of labels that used inconsistently is no more helpful than a list of undifferentiated issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Labeling issues as "for newcomers" or "help wanted" allows project maintainers to flag issues particularly suited to contributors who have just joined the project.
Labeling issues in this way shows that the project is prepared to onboard new contributors and that maintainers welcome community assistance in a particular area.
Don&#8217;t be afraid to file issues against project documentation, the website,or anything else you feel is amiss.
If there&#8217;s a place current and potential contributors can help make the project better, file these in your issue tracker with a clear label that shows them they can contribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just make <em>very clear</em> (either in the text of the "help wanted" issue or via a link to other project documentation) how you wish others to engage with the project when working on these types of issues.
(The <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html">Apache Subversion Issues page</a> is an excellent example of clearly articulating needs to the user community before they file an issue.) It is best to encourage contributors working on these issues to engage with the project maintainers along the way, so their contributions have a higher chance of acceptance into the project.
Nothing squelches a contributor&#8217;s enthusiasm like showing up with a working solution to the stated problem only to be told their particular implementation will not meet the project&#8217;s needs.</p>

<p>In particular, if someone has submitted an issue along with code to fix a problem or implement a new feature, it is vital to tell them why their work has not been accepted by the project.
Not doing so makes the contributor feel like they&#8217;ve wasted their time and should devote their energies to a different software project.
In an ideal world, you are able to include a link to a published project roadmap that explains why the submission does not meet the needs of the project.
(See above.)
. For new contributor submissions, fix minor issues with the patch yourself along with a note about what you fixed and why.
Having a patch rejected for minor nits discourages additional contribution, and often it takes just as long to explain why a patch is being rejected as it does to make very small fixes.
Such explanations are an excellent time to point contributors to additional project resources, such as your coding style guide, documentation on communication norms, etc.
. For submissions coming in response to a "help wanted" issue, engage early and often with the person who has stated an interest in working on the issue.
Doing so ensures that the contributor&#8217;s submission will actually meet the project&#8217;s needs.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conventional wisdom in the early days of open source software development held that communities should <em>not</em> carry on development related discussions in the project&#8217;s issue tracker.
Project&#8217;s instead preferred carrying on such conversations via mailing lists or in forums a number of reasons:
PD&#8212;&#8203;I don&#8217;t follow "Project&#8217;s instead" as the subject of the sentence. Am I missing something? Also, I suggest creating a bulleted list after "reasons:".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>People following the mailing list were able to comment and express their views and needs without needing to parse through the issue tracker
PD&#8212;&#8203;Start your bulleted list here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Forum or mailing list conversations were seen as better for asynchronous and long-form communications, and popular issue trackers in the 1990s and early 2000s were an unwieldy way to engage in actual discourse.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Second item in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discovering why a particular technical decision was made when those details were buried in an issue tracker was difficult, especially since the issue would be in a "closed" state once the decision was made.
Looking for a closed issue to explain the technical direction of the project was considered counterintuitive.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Final item in the list</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the rise in popularity of GitHub as a one-stop platform for online development work, conversations in the project issue tracker have become mainstream.
GitHub&#8217;s issue system visually mirrors the typically expected visual interface for forum software, making discussions in its system seem natural for those who began their development careers when online forums were first gaining popularity.
Further, time and resources necessary for maintaining a Mailman instance or additional forum software as part of project infrastructure became cumbersome when all other infrastructure could be managed via a single tool.
The addition of features such as the ability to "+1" an issue, set fine-grained controls on notifications for specific issues, and lock specific issues for editing only by project maintainers (while still allowing others to view the issue) made the move to discussions in the issue tracker more palatable and effective.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Is it locking the issue to "editing only" or is it project maintainers should be the only editors?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nonetheless, interested parties should be able to follow discussions <em>outside</em> the project&#8217;s issue tracker.
Only the most deeply interested and invested individuals will rigorously follow every issue update, making engaging with the project difficult for casual contributors.
While excellent search capabilities in online issue trackers make finding closed issues easier, the flow of an issue discussion does not fulfill the same function as a narrative description of a particular implementation or an explanation of why a certain decision was made.
Note, too, that some maintainers who are most intimately familiar with the project—those who can recall specific issue numbers for particular discussions with ease—will not always be available to help with the project work.
Preserving the knowledge of key decisions in an easy-to-access way saves time for people working to uncover the why of project processes, saves time for maintainers so they need not rehash history regularly, and ensures that critical details on how and why decisions were made are always available even as project membership changes.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Should it be "about" instead of "of key&#8230;&#8203;"? Also, this sentence is long. You could theoretically turn it into a bulleted list spotlighting each of the three things preserving knowledge allows for.</p>

<h4 id="_be_kind_and_welcoming_regardless_of_english_proficiency">3.6.3. Be kind and welcoming regardless of English proficiency</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this chapter has stressed numerous times, kind and gracious communication with all those who participate in your project should be a default mode of behavior for interactions.
The same holds true when communicating with people for whom writing in English is difficult.
If you have trouble understanding what someone is saying or asking for, ask clarifying questions to let them know you will be happy to help them.
Don&#8217;t simply ignore someone or tell them they are not welcome in the project due to limited proficiency in written English.</p>

<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
People who are not native speakers of English often begin their communication with the project with an apology for their poor English language skills.
When receiving such a communication, thank the sender for writing and let them know you appreciate their efforts to communicate with the project.
Where possible, point them to any resources that may be available to them in a language with which they are more familiar, for example a Spanish language forum or a Chinese language mailing list for the project.

<h4 id="_avoid_idiom_in_written_documentation">3.6.4. Avoid idiom in written documentation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every language features various phrases the actual words of which do not convey the intended meaning of the phrase, such as "over the moon" to mean extremely happy or excited or "raining cats and dogs" to refer to a serious downpour of rain.
For those who grow up in a particular culture, the meanings of these phrases are obvious.
But they can be confusing for those who lack the proper context for them.
Rather than rely on idiomatic phrases, use plain language in written documentation to ensure the writing is most accessible to all people.</p>

<h4 id="_expand_acronyms_and_provide_a_glossary">3.6.5. Expand acronyms and provide a glossary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While acronyms are a useful way for those completely familiar with a topic to save time and effort typing and speaking longer phrases, they obfuscate information for those less familiar with the topic.
Further, acronyms are often overloaded, meaning that the acronym can expand several different ways depending upon the topic area.
For example, someone completely new to a project may not understand that "LGTM" means "looks good to me" and that their work is therefore acceptable for merging into the project&#8217;s source repository.
If you regularly use particular acronyms as part of communicating in your project, take the time to create a quick glossary of these terms.
Updating this glossary is a quick and easy way for volunteers to contribute.</p>

<h4 id="_actively_seek_participation_from_localization_volunteers">3.6.6. Actively seek participation from localization volunteers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, project maintainers should always be clear about <em>what kind of help</em> they&#8217;re seeking from their communities.
One key area in which to ask for help is the localization of documentation resources.
Regardless of their skill level with software development practices, community members can actively grow the project and improve it by translating documentation, thereby making the project more accessible to more people and more potential contributors.
Maintainers should be explicit about their desire to recruit contributors focused on localization.</p>

<h3 id="_documenting_your_projects_communication_norms">3.7. Documenting your project&#8217;s communication norms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When people approach a new project, they seek to understand how they can best engage with that project and interact with its community.
Be sure your documentation clearly outlines your project&#8217;s various communication channels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply <em>listing</em> communication channels is not sufficient.
Your documentation must make clear <em>what</em> each channel is used for, <em>when</em> to use a particular communication mechanism, and <em>how</em> people can expect to receive communications from the project and its community members through that channel.
For example, a project with few maintainers who develop the work as a hobby project may wish to note on the project website that those developing the project do so in their spare time, so immediate responses to mailing list inquiries should not be expected.
Someone whose hobby project is in use with enterprises might like to make explicit the notion that help is provided on a best effort basis.
(Doing so sets expectations appropriately for those who are less familiar with how open source project communities function.)</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_maintaining_civil_discourse">3.7.1. Maintaining civil discourse</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As has been discussed throughout this chapter, maintaining kind and gracious communications is vital for the project&#8217;s ongoing health and well-being.
While assuming everyone understands what "kind and gracious communication" looks like may seem natural, one cannot assume a consistent meaning for all participants, especially when dealing with a global audience.
Project maintainers and community members do well to lead by example, but making an explicit statement about what constitutes civil discourse, what matters are off-topic for the project, and what is expected from anyone communicating with the project about matters that may cause conflict sets an appropriate tone for the project.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Consider breaking into two sentences to make the thought easier for the reader to digest. Also, is "about matters that may cause conflict" too restrictive. Shouldn&#8217;t the expectations be for whenever you are communicating with the project?</p>

<p>This excerpt from the Diversity Statement of the Dreamwidth project is an excellent example of how to document project communication norms.
It is clear that everyone is welcome in the project, regardless of personal background, technical skill level, or focus for using the project.
It makes it clear that mistakes will be made and that people are expected to use these imperfections as learning opportunities, not excuses to belittle other people.
The statement tells users and would-be contributors that they may not always get what they want from the project maintainers, but that errors will be fixed and reasonable requests will be listened to, if not acted upon.
Most notably, it&#8217;s a list of expected <em>prosocial behaviors</em> rather than simply a list of what <em>not to do</em>.
It identifies behavior the project maintainers and community members model and transforms it from the actions they take into words that help everyone understand what actions constitute good project citizenship.</p>

<h4 id="_developing_a_project_social_contract">3.7.2. Developing a project social contract</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As projects document their community communication norms, they may find developing a project social contract to be a particularly effective exercise.
A project social contract documents behaviors the project expects all participants to display and sets expectations for how project members will be accountable to others.
The social contract is not necessarily a list of forbidden behaviors, but rather a statement about how members of the project will choose to self-govern for everyone&#8217;s success.
By undertaking the process of creating a social contract through dialogue, members establish empathy with one another and set the foundation for future conversations.</p>

<h4 id="_codes_of_conduct">3.7.3. Codes of conduct</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects use a code of conduct as a means to document their expectations around civil discourse.
Open source projects that seek any outside contribution should always have a code of conduct.
For projects that host events, whether virtual or in person, developing code of conduct specific language around events is also a best practice.
Think of the code of conduct as an aspect of the project&#8217;s social contract, one that includes the rules by which the community will govern itself and how each member will hold one another accountable for those moments when they could have behaved differently and achieved a better outcome.
These rules must be understood and made explicit.
Otherwise people will know neither what is expected of them nor whether the project is a place where they will feel welcome and comfortable contributing their time and expertise.

<h3 id="_successfully_communicating_with_an_open_source_project">3.8. Successfully communicating with an open source project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve focused primarily on ways in which software project <em>maintainers</em> can ensure the best possible outcomes for communication in their projects.
However, contributors, too, can take a number of steps to ensure they&#8217;re communicating effectively with their favorite open source communities.
Here are just a few:
PD&#8212;&#8203;Some of the bullets are rather long. Look to pare down when possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Read the project website and documentation before jumping into discussions</strong>.
By taking the time to read about the project and understand its nuances, you demonstrate that you respect the time and attention of the people producing the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do your research, and tell people you&#8217;ve done it.</strong>
If you run into a problem using open source software, do what you can to solve the problem yourself.
There&#8217;s no shame in not being able to do so, but make sure to include what steps you have taken to resolve the issue when filing a bug report or asking for help in one of the project&#8217;s communication channels.
Doing so saves people time and energy, as they will not ask you to try something you have already done.
Further, listing the ways you&#8217;ve already attempted to help yourself is a demonstration of respect for the time and energy of the project&#8217;s maintainers.
<strong>Practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology">basic netiquette</a>.</strong>
Most fundamental advice for communicating on the internet is applicable in open source projects and communities.
For instance, avoid typing in all capital letters, as this style is read as shouting (and one would not go about asking for help by shouting at someone).
Choose a username or screen name that is reasonable and approachable, otherwise you risk not being taken seriously by others.
Wait a reasonable amount of time—say 24 to 48 hours—for a response to your inquiry before trying to get a response in a different communication channel.
You may find Virgina Shea&#8217;s oft-cited <a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html">The Core Rules of Netiquette</a> to be a useful resource if you are unfamiliar with the rules of engagement in internet communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post questions and communications in the appropriate places.</strong>
Encountering information in a place people don&#8217;t expect can overwhelm them.
For example, using a project issue tracker to let folks know you are hosting a hackfest next week is inappropriate.
If the project has taken the time to let contributors know how and where to ask questions—and you should know this by following the guidance in the first item on this list—make sure to use the appropriate forum to do so.
Demonstrating you have taken the time and energy to interact with the project&#8217;s maintainers and other volunteers in the way they&#8217;ve asked shows you respect their efforts and, in turn, makes helping you be successful much easier for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make the subject of your posts as meaningful as possible.</strong>
When writing the subject line of an email or forum post, make your needs explicit.
For example, a subject line that says "I think I found a bug" is likely to be acted upon more slowly than one that says "external display not recognized upon upgrading to version 2.2."
The second subject tells the reader that they will likely find more detail on how to diagnose the problem, and that they are dealing with someone who understands the limited amount of time and attention the reader has.
The first subject does not differentiate the sender&#8217;s problem in any way, and makes it difficult for your communication to be memorable to the reader.
The more useful the subject of your post, the more likely you are to receive a prompt reply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be kind and courteous in all your communications.</strong>
Once more, let&#8217;s stress that the key to effective communication in any project—open source software or otherwise—is thoughtful and gracious behavior.
Do not show up at an open source project angrily demanding help for your problems, send impolite follow up messages when you do not get an immediate answer, or otherwise be unkind to the people with whom you are communicating.
Take the time to thank them for their help and for providing the project to you and everyone else.
Remember you are communicating with other people, some of whom are spending their free time to write your free software.
Treat them with the respect and courtesy you want for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="_evolving_communications_in_open_source_projects_and_academia">3.9. Evolving communications in open source projects and academia</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While open source software now seems ubiquitous, we should recall that the free and open source software movements are still in their early stages.
Development of the Linux operating system began in 1991.
The Apache Software Foundation, steward of many of the world&#8217;s most notable open source projects, was incorporated in 1999.
Though 20 or 30 years seems like ancient history on the internet, it is worth noting that Ada Lovelace created the world&#8217;s first algorithm back in the 1840s.
Open source is still a blip (albeit a significant one) in a much longer technological timeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Academic researchers have found open source software projects and their development methodologies particularly worthy of study, due to open source&#8217;s disruptive influence in the software industry.
PD&#8212;&#8203;Consider flip flopping the order and beginning with "Due to open &#8230;&#8203;".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, as projects' communication tools and platforms have evolved, researchers' ability to access project data for the purpose of study has been, at times, diminished.
For example, parsing IRC logs of a project&#8217;s real-time chat often yielded fruitful information about a particular project, but as some projects have moved to other chat systems, such logs are no longer commonly available (nor has there been any guaranteed longevity of the project&#8217;s chat archives, depending on which communication tool the project chooses).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a project launches or consists of a small group of people working together, choices for how to communicate and where to do so often arise organically and with little consideration to the future impact of those choices.
But project maintainers should thoughtfully consider how they can ensure the project&#8217;s communications—which contain potentially rich sources of data and historical artifacts like lore and decisions histories—are effectively captured for both the project participants and interested observers.
To understand how researchers benchmark community activity and analyse the outputs of various parts of your project, consider reviewing the work of the <a href="https://chaoss.community/"><em>Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software</em></a> (CHAOSS) Project.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion_2">3.10. Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most effective way to achieve communication in open source projects is to show others kindness and courtesy, and to assume good intent upon first contact with people you&#8217;ve never met.
Though this chapter contains any number of helpful best practices for effective communication, simply acting with graciousness to other people is the most important step one can take to communicate well.
Remember there is a human being reading what you have written, and remember to treat them with the same respect you want for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="_introduction_3">4.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll discuss assessing and evolving an open source project or community governance model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All organizations operate in and with governance structures.
The term "governance" carries multiple meanings in an organizational context.
It can refer to regulatory matters or risk management issues, for example.
More generally, though, it can also refer to a system of rules, roles, and procedures that determine how power in an organization gets distributed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because open source projects are organizations, every one features governance structures.
Some of these structures are more <em>explicit</em> than others.
Some are more <em>formal</em> than others.
But every project has them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, too many discussions of open source project governance focus on activities or resources, like "speaking for the project" or "ownership of the web domain."
While documenting these functions is useful, these are not, strictly speaking, governance issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its heart, open source project and community governance is about <em>people</em>—their rights and responsibilities as part of a project, and the expectations others have for them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_governance">4.2. What is governance?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply put, "governance" refers <strong>to the rules or customs that determine who gets to do what (or is supposed to do what), how they&#8217;re supposed to do it, and when.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two categories of governance-related issues are most pertinent to open source projects: those related to <strong>roles</strong> and those related to <strong>policies and procedures</strong>.
For the purpose of explanation, we&#8217;ll discuss each of these issues separately.
In practice, however, they&#8217;re inseparable—two sides of the same coin, as our forthcoming example will demonstrate.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_roles">4.2.1. Roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A great deal of activity hinges on roles-related governance in open source projects.
Think of a <strong>role</strong> as a function someone in the project performs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When analyzing your own project&#8217;s roles-related governance systems, ask the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What roles do (or can) project contributors play?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualifies a person to play a particular role in the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What duties, privileges, and forms of authority are associated with each role?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What project resources are the province or responsibility of people who perform certain roles?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_policies_and_procedures">4.2.2. Policies and procedures</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While contributors occupy certain roles in an open source project, the project&#8217;s governance structure also determines how those people do what they do as part of the project.
<strong>Policies and procedures</strong> refer to the processes and guidelines contributors follow when performing their roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When analyzing your project&#8217;s procedure- or -policy-related governance systems, ask the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do code and documentation get accepted into the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do contributors come to occupy and eventually depart from certain
roles in the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can role descriptions and responsibilities be changed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do project decisions get made (and by whom)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are debates and conflicts resolved (and by whom)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_roles_policies_procedures_an_example">4.2.3. Roles, policies, procedures: An example</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember: A project&#8217;s <strong>roles</strong> and its <strong>policies and procedures</strong> aren&#8217;t discrete; they&#8217;re interwoven as part of the project&#8217;s overall governance model.
For example, consider a project role called "Documentation Maintainer." A project might outline that role this way:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Role Title: Documentation Maintainer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualifications: several years of consistent contributions to
documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Role: other Documentation Maintainers can nominate and vote
to grant this role to eligible contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duties: write documentation and review documentation from other
contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privileges: speak for the documentation team, participate in
development meetings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authority: ultimate decision on documentation content, technology, and
strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Procedure: other Documentation Maintainers vote on changes to
role description</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many cases, a project&#8217;s actual role descriptions are more elaborate than that (some projects' role handbooks are dozens of pages long).
As projects mature, the number of different roles people play in them can increase.
Moreover, larger and more mature projects associate roles with <em>collectives</em>—that is, a group of contributors can perform a certain role jointly.
For instance, a project might feature several "steering committees," each with its own set of election procedures.
This is true for the Kubernetes project, where "special interest groups" are a popular unit of governance.
In that project, the role of Code Contributor is subdivided further by interest group (team) and by contributor level (Member, Reviewer, Approver, and Owner).
So a contributor&#8217;s <em>actual</em> role would be something like "SIG‒Network Approver," not just "Code Contributor."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_governance">4.3. Why governance?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some open source communities, "governance" gets a bad rap.
This is true in cases where project contributors tend to construe governance as a purely negative force—a set of rules or procedures aimed solely at telling people what they <em>can&#8217;t</em> do, how they <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> act, or how they should <em>limit</em> themselves to acting only within certain boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But a well-crafted governance model can in fact be a largely positive force in open source communities.
A project&#8217;s governance model outlines that project&#8217;s "terms of engagement"—the specific, tried-and-tested structures for working together and making decisions that project contributors have found works best for the community.
A clear governance model can <em>encourage</em> new contributors to become involved in your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A well-designed system of governance is much less likely to turn away or de-motivate project participants than a vague or non-existent one is.
Consider your project from the perspective of new contributors.
Are new contributors <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> likely to jump into a project without any sense of the role they&#8217;re supposed to play and the rules they&#8217;re supposed to follow when they want others to seriously consider your contributions?
A clear governance model helps people understand precisely how they can make an immediate contribution to a project, how they can pitch in without "rocking the boat," how they can escalate questions or issues if they have them, and what sorts of leadership
positions they can aspire to if they stick around long enough.
So a community&#8217;s goal in architecting a governance model should be <em>making structures of participation obvious</em>.
When your project&#8217;s rules are clear, contributors can engage with confidence.
Taking this approach to governance can positively impact a project&#8217;s long-term viability and growth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_making_governance_explicit">4.4. Making governance explicit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that <em>every</em> open source project features different roles contributors can play and procedures that people in those roles are typically (or should be) following.
This is true whether or not those roles and procedures are actually <em>documented</em> anywhere.
Where roles aren&#8217;t documented, they are implicit in regular contributors' activities (and not infrequently a source of argument).
Successful open source projects make their governance models <em>explicit</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a 2018 study, <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/4/new-governance-model-research">researcher
Javier Canovas found</a> that 19 of the 25 most-starred projects on GitHub hadn&#8217;t published documents outlining their governance models.
Canovas considered this unfortunate for several reasons.
"First, [explicit governance] helps promote an organization&#8217;s sense of transparency," he writes.
"One could know how much time a group takes to consider an issue, the chances contributions have of making an impact on the organization, or who is going to hear their voices when they speak up.
Second, explicitly defining a governance model may also help one better understand and classify how open organizations are driven."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how this works: In 2018, the Kubernetes project added a set of detailed, comprehensive Role Handbooks for their Release Team.
These handbooks outlined information related to the Release Team role, including qualifications necessary for joining the team, duties members of the team perform, and details on the team&#8217;s decision-making processes.
As a result, the Release Team became the most popular point of entry for project contributions; new participants knew exactly what to expect.
Other teams within Kubernetes followed suit—and experienced a doubling or even tripling number of new contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clear and explicit governance models have another critical benefit: cultivating a strong sense of trust in your project&#8217;s community.
Members of projects with robust, detailed governance models benefit from a shared commitment to a transparent set of procedures, policies, and role descriptions.
They can appeal to a commonly understood set of guidelines when disputes arise.
All this makes questions about participants motives, intentions, goals, and authority less contentious.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_community_originated_projects_evolve">4.5. How community-originated projects evolve</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source projects rarely begin by "selecting" and implementing a perfectly preconceived governance model.
Much more commonly, projects' governance models <em>evolve</em> as their communities grow and diversify.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In its early days, a project might only have one or two developers—making discussions of "governance" largely irrelevant (the project is simply not big enough to have a need for any structured decision-making process).
But this will change as the project attracts additional contributors.
And because a project&#8217;s governance model, its culture, and the behaviors of its leaders are all intimately entwined, any change to one will likely spur changes in the others.
While every project is different—growing in its own way and following its own trajectory of maturation—we might note certain common, recurring milestones in a project&#8217;s development that tend to trigger governance evolutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_work_among_founders_1_or_2_members">4.5.1. Work among founders (1 or 2 members)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects that start with a single developer (or small group of developers) do not often require any formal governance structure.
Gauging consensus is easy, and during the early stages of a project, disagreements about what should be done (and who should do it) are rare.
A project&#8217;s early members all typically have carte blanche to take the actions they see as best for the project, like approving code for inclusion.
Normally, no structure is required in addition to a GitHub repository, and all early developers receive project membership status
almost immediately.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_early_project_growth_up_to_5_members">4.5.2. Early project growth (up to 5 members)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As projects begin growing, the limitations of this approach become obvious.
When a project has even five developers, coordinating work becomes more difficult, and newer developers may not be immediately familiar with the design choices and coding standards the project&#8217;s early developers have followed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the first evolution projects tend to undergo is often one that requires code submissions to undergo peer review before being merged.
The "first level" of the project&#8217;s hierarchy consists of those with the authority to approve pull requests or code submissions for inclusion in the project.
Initially, deciding who receives this power is easy; the project&#8217;s original, trusted developers all receive it, and the project founder acts as final arbiter in case of disagreements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mid_term_project_growth_10_to_15_members">4.5.3. Mid-term project growth (10 to 15 members)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next event to trigger a project governance evolution is often related to how people who join the project become members of the group.
This tends to occur when the size of the project has increased to approximately 10 or 15 developers.
At this point, a project community typically must develop more formal guidelines for admitting new project members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One common standard projects use to assess new members is sustained participation (how long and how often the contributor has been active in the project) combined with a judgment about what one might call "good taste"—an assessment about the quality of work a contributor tends to submit, that contributors good judgement in review comments, etc.
Still, the project founder tends to be the gatekeeper and final arbiter of who gets "promoted" inside the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_corporate_originated_projects_evolve">4.6. How corporate-originated projects evolve</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some open source projects that begin life as the work of a professional software development team operating in a corporate environment tend to evolve somewhat differently.
Because these projects originate in corporate environments, they often inherit the organizational structure of those environments.
They may, for example, already feature a robust group of developers with their own notions of hierarchy (managers, architects, junior and senior developers, and so on).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_early_stage_corporate_originated_projects">4.6.1. Early-stage corporate-originated projects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initial efforts to increase community engagement in the projects tends to focus on growing adoption and engaging with early users.
Pre-existing developer teams typically continue project planning, however, in a centralized manner.
For this reason, external contributors may find engaging with the project more difficult—and the project may not gain sufficient traction as a result.
The rapid pace of project changes, the opacity of the planning process, and the strength of pre-existing relationships between the project&#8217;s developers can make feature development more difficult for external contributors.
Early patch submissions may stay unreviewed for longer periods of time, and these submissions will be relatively infrequent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is as far as many corporate-originated projects will evolve.
While the core team may engage actively with the project&#8217;s user base, resources required to <em>grow</em> that developer base are considerable, and many organizations choose not to make the investment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, one oft-cited benefit of the open source model is an ability to collaborate with industry partners and competitors and share the burden of development of common requirements.
If this is a goal, then growing participation in a corporate-originated project beyond a single vendor is critical.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_evolving_to_multi_vendor_corporate_open_source">4.6.2. Evolving to multi-vendor corporate open source</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For corporate-originated projects, expanding project participation involves engaging with both interested individuals who are using the project and vendors who might be motivated to invest in the project.
Uniting these parties will have implications for project governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many projects begin enticing other vendors to contribute by demonstrating a viable market for the project.
Vendors typically do not invest sustainably in open source projects unless they can justify that investment.
Illustrating significant and enthusiastic user adoption of the software is therefore critical at this stage.
Initial efforts focus on accelerating adoption momentum and successfully converting <em>users</em> into <em>contributors</em> by soliciting their active participation in the project roadmap and project promotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, a project may attempt to engage with other vendors by focusing on encouraging collaborators to "build on" a common platform.
While companies may not be able to justify significant investment in the project "core," they may be able to justify investment in <em>extensions</em> to a project—if those extensions are relatively inexpensive and can support their business.
For example, by focusing initial outreach and engagement efforts on APIs, developer experience for extensions, and the path to distribution for people <em>writing</em> those extensions, projects may grow large communities of vendors building <em>atop</em> a platform, rather than modifying the core platform itself.
Distinguishing these two areas of development—between the "core" and the "periphery"—often involves making governance decisions specific to each (only some project roles may receive permission to operate in the project "core," for instance).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a corporate-originated project has demonstrated substantial market opportunity (either by proving that the project fills a significant gap in the market or by growing a large user base directly), it can engage with potential vendor partners to collaborate on the project.
This discussion is partly technical and partly business-focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before making a significant investment of engineering resources in a project, vendors will likely ask:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Can we engage with the project on a level playing field? Or do stakeholders use different processes to evaluate changes from different vendors (Contributor Licensing Agreements that give additional rights to the originating vendor over others, for example)? One common way to ensure a level playing field from a legal perspective is to contribute the project&#8217;s management and trademark to a foundation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this project meet a customer need? Vendors will consider market fit, and how the project fits into their product portfolio.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accepting participation from additional vendors can significantly impact a project&#8217;s governance.
One way to ease potentially turbulent impacts is to target vendors with whom the originating vendor does not compete directly.
For example, a cloud hosting company may have more success recruiting a vendor of on-premise software products to its project than it would recruiting a competing hosting vendor.
Competing vendors may only be willing to join when a project can demonstrate a consistent record of multi-vendor engagement in the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_governing_sustained_evolution">4.7. Governing sustained evolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once project participation reaches a kind of "critical mass," many common patterns emerge—regardless of whether an individual or corporation has initiated a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all the cases we&#8217;ve discussed so far, rules and procedures for decision making tend to be implicit.
And since most open source projects never recruit more than 10 active developers (or one core vendor), most projects never reach a point where explicitly documenting project governance becomes necessary.
Those that do, however, will likely adopt even more nuanced and complex governance models.
See "Examples of open source governance models" below to learn more about these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, when projects reach this size, they seek to transition management and trademark of a project to an independent entity (usually called "foundations" in the open source world).
On rare occasions, projects may establish their own independent consortium for this purpose.
More frequently, however, a project will approach an existing foundation (such as the Apache Foundation, the Linux Foundation, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the OpenStack Foundation, or the Software Freedom Conservancy, to name just a few) and ask the foundation to adopt the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When selecting a foundation with whom to partner in this way, open source projects must make several considerations, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>cost structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance requirements imposed by the foundation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>affinity of the foundation with the user and developer base of the project</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, projects will commonly discuss the extent to which member fees should influence the project&#8217;s technical governance. Two dominant models for this governance exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is a strict "church and state" separation, where the members who join at the highest membership level have input into (and can influence) project budgetary matters (for example, how funds will be disbursed between infrastructure, headcount, marketing, events), but technical merit dictates how the project is governed technically.
The second is a "pure member" organization, where members are entitled to appoint representatives to a technical governing board with oversight on which sub-projects will be adopted in the project, and how the projects will be governed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foundations can play another key role in a project&#8217;s evolution: defining the market dynamics <em>around</em> the project, including administration of the project trademark.
A trademark is one of an open source project&#8217;s most valuable resources for guaranteeing that vendors are distributing the project (or derivatives of it) in a way which does not damage the project&#8217;s reputation.
Open source projects commonly use trademark certification as a way to "bless" certain vendor products in the market or to influence the way derivative products behave.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects hold tightly to the idea that contributors are <em>individual</em> contributors and not representatives of companies for which they may happen to work.
In mature open source projects (like Apache or the Linux kernel), this allows people to maintain community status and seniority even when they change employers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_examples_of_open_source_project_governance_models">4.8. Examples of open source project governance models</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_do_ocracy">4.8.1. "Do-ocracy"</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source projects adopting the "do-ocracy" governance model tend to forgo formal and elaborate governance conventions and instead insist that "decisions are made by those who do the work." In other words: In a do-ocracy, members gain authority by making the most consistent contributions.
Peer review remains common under this model; however, individual contributors tend to retain <em>de facto</em> decision-making power over project components on which they&#8217;ve worked most closely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this reason, some do-ocracies will claim to have "no governance at all," relying instead on individual stakeholders' authority to make decisions on matters "where they&#8217;ve done the most work."
But as we&#8217;ve already explained, such claims about an absence of governance are misguided.
Every open source project has a governance model. In the case of most do-ocracies, the governance model is merely implicit in the everyday interactions of project members.
As a result, joining them can be difficult and intimidating for newcomers, as would-be contributors might not immediately know how to participate or seek approval for their contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Find an aspect of the project you feel you can improve and simply begin working.
Review the recorded history of changes to the project to identify the participants whose feedback will be integral to your successful contribution.
As the project accepts more of your contributions, you will gradually accrue influence in the community.
Do not expect to influence decisions in a do-ocracy until you are able to demonstrate a history of successful contribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_founder_leader">4.8.2. Founder-leader</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The founder-leader governance model is most common among new projects or those with a small number of contributors (and since most open source projects have only a small number of contributors, this is a rather popular model!).
In these projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project, establishes its vision, controls all permissions to merge code into it, and assumes the right to speak for it in public.
Some projects refer to their founder-leaders as "BDFLs" or "Benevolent Dictators for Life."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In projects following the founder-leader model, lines of power and authority are typically quite clear; they radiate from founder-leaders, who are the final decision-makers for all project matters.
This model&#8217;s limitations become apparent as a project grows to a certain size.
Separating the founder-leaders' personal preferences from project design decisions eventually becomes difficult, and founder-leaders can become bottlenecks for project decision-making work.
In extreme cases, founder-leader models can create a kind of "caste" system in a project, as non-founders begin feeling like they&#8217;re unable to affect changes that aren&#8217;t in line with a founder&#8217;s vision.
Disagreements can lead to project splits.
Worse, a founder-leader&#8217;s disappearance, whether due to burnout or planned retirement, can cause a project to disintegrate entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Browse project mailing lists or discussion forums to identify the project&#8217;s founder-leaders, then address questions about participation and contribution to those leaders through one of the community&#8217;s public communication channels.
Founder-leaders tend to have a comprehensive view of the project&#8217;s needs and will direct you to areas of the project that will benefit most from your contribution.
Be sure to understand founder-leaders' vision for the project, as most founder-leaders will veto proposed changes they feel conflict with that vision.
When starting out, do not expect to propose changes that will not serve the founder-leaders' vision for the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_self_appointing_council_or_board">4.8.3. Self-appointing council or board</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recognizing shortcomings of the founder-leader model, the self-appointing council or board model aims to better facilitate community leadership turnover and succession.
Under this model, members of an open source project may appoint a number of leadership groups to govern various aspects of a project.
Such groups may have names like "steering committee," "committer council," "technical operating committee, "architecture council," or "board of directors."
And typically, these groups construct their own decision-making conventions and succession procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The self-appointing council or board governance model is useful in cases where a project does not have a sponsoring foundation and establishing electoral mechanisms is prohibitively difficult.
But the model&#8217;s drawbacks become apparent when self-appointing governing groups grow insular and unrepresentative of the entire project community (as member-selection processes tend to spawn self-reinforcing leadership cultures).
Moreover, this model can stymie community participation in leadership activities, as community members often feel like they must "wait to be chosen" before they can take initiative on work that interests them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Because this governance model is typical of more mature open source projects, communities adopting this model will often curate getting started documentation aimed at assisting potential contributors.
Find this documentation and read it first.
Then read the project&#8217;s governance documentation to determine how its governing bodies are composed.
In many cases, you can locate a council or board governing the aspect of the project to which you would like to make a contribution.
That body will be able to oversee your contribution and answer questions you may have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_electoral">4.8.4. Electoral</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some open source projects choose to conduct governance through elections.
They may hold elections for various roles, or conduct similar electoral processes to ratify or update project policies and procedures.
Under the electoral model, communities establish and document electoral procedures to which they all agree, then enact those procedures as a regular matter of decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This model is more common in larger open source projects where multiple qualified and interested contributors offer to play the same role.
Elections are also common for projects with a sponsor (a foundation, for example), because an electoral process can make the allocation of sponsor resources more transparent.
Electoral governance also tends to lead to precise documentation of project roles, procedures, and participation guidelines.
When election documents make these matters explicit, they help new contributors maximize their involvement in a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But elections also have drawbacks.
They can become contentious, distracting, and time-consuming for all project members (whether those members are running or not).
Some communities promote elections as a solution to the indefinite tenure of well-known project members; however, elections don&#8217;t generally cause turnover unless term limits are part of the project&#8217;s policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Communities appointing leaders through elections typically feature election results and a leadership roster prominently on their project websites.
Review those documents to determine a point of contact in the project.
Well- governed open source communities will make clear, also often on their project websites, their pro- cesses for proposing and reviewing items on which the community will vote.
As you establish a reputation for making useful contributions to the project, you may eventually decide to be a candidate for a project leadership position.
Be sure to interact productively and collaborate effectively with other contributors as they may be voting you into a leadership position some day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_single_vendor">4.8.5. Single-vendor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally, individual companies or industry consortia may choose to distribute software under the terms of an open source license as a way of reaching potential developers and users—even if they do not accept project contributions from those audiences.
They might do this to accelerate adoption of their work, spur development activity atop a software platform, support a plugin ecosystem, or avoid the overhead required for cultivating an external developer community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under this model, the governing organization usually does not accept contributions from anyone outside it.
Instead, open and closed source innovation occurs at the "edges" of the project.
For this reason, some commentators call this the "walled garden" governance model.
Occasionally, projects following this model will adopt license with strong "copyleft" requirements, which they see as a deterrent to commercial competitors benefitting from their work on the project (the goal is to force competitors and customers with production requirements to purchase a non-open source license for the software—what some call a "dual license" approach).
This model becomes problematic in cases where a project claims to have an open community but is in fact wholly owned by a company or consortium.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> First, consider any existing relationship between your employer and the company originating the project, if applicable.
Next, assess the project&#8217;s licensing terms and review its change history and bug tracker to determine whether you are able to contribute to the aspect of the project that interests you — and in the way you would like.
Given the project&#8217;s particular licensing stipulations, you may find yourself working alongside or on top of a particular project rather than contributing to it directly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_foundation_backed">4.8.6. Foundation-backed</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To exert greater control over resources and project code, some open source projects choose to be managed by an incorporated NGO (non-government organization), such as a charitable nonprofit or trade association.
Doing this allows the "project," as an abstract entity, to take ownership of resources like servers, trademarks, patents, and insurance policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, foundation leadership and project leadership can form a single governance structure that manages all aspects of the open source project.
In other cases, the foundation manages some matters (such as trademarks and events) and other governance structures in the project(s) control other matters (such as code approval).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extensive funding and legal requirements normally limit this model to larger open source projects.
However, many smaller projects choose to join larger "umbrella" foundations (like the Software Freedom
Conservancy or the Linux Foundation) to reap some of the benefits of this governance model.
This governance model is advantageous for projects seeking to establish legal relationships with third parties (like conference venues) or projects seeking to ensure successful leadership transitions following departure of key individuals.
It might also help prevent the commercialization of the project under a single vendor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High overhead (not strictly financial, but particularly in terms of contributor time, which can be substantial) is a significant drawback of the foundation-backed governance model.
Some foundations are incorporated as industry consortia, in which sponsoring companies govern the organization.
Different consortia allow different degrees of participation from individual project contributors; some are fairly open groups, while in others only corporate managers have authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get started in a project with this governance model: If a foundation does not govern day-to-day project contribution activity, then locate the project&#8217;s getting started documentation and follow it.
Otherwise, note that individual projects under a particular foundation&#8217;s umbrella will have their own sets of leaders, though some common guidelines may standardize basic contribution processes across all projects a foundation governs.
To identify a specific project&#8217;s leaders, consider addressing a request to the foundation members' mailing list.
You might also examine the project&#8217;s change history to identify frequent contributors and contact them.
As many foundations feature a contribution-based voting system, familiarize yourself with steps required to become a full voting member of the foundation.
If the foundation is a members-only industry consortium, determine whether your employer is already a member.
If not, talk to your manager about the importance of the project to your work and ask whether your employer might consider joining.
In either case, foundation projects may require signing contributor paperwork.
Your legal department should assist with reviewing and signing this paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="_conducting_basic_governance">4.9. Conducting basic governance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve discussed the nature and importance of open source project and community governance, factors that trigger evolutions in project governance models, and a few of the most popular open source governance models.
Finally, let&#8217;s examine some concrete steps you can take to structure your own community&#8217;s governance—whether you&#8217;re launching a new project or evolving one that&#8217;s already active.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that most governance models consist of two primary dimensions: roles, and policies and procedures.
The basic requirements here are actually quite spartan, and can be evolved as the project grows.
What follows constitutes a kind of "minimum viable product" for project governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In your project, each of the following sections could very well be its own document. Or  they might simply be part of a single long README—or anything in between.
What&#8217;s important it to get the basics of how things work down in text, so that people thinking about participating in your project know where to go, who to talk to, and most of all aren&#8217;t horribly surprised.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_importance_of_honesty">4.9.1. The importance of honesty</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing governance documentation, it can be tempting to define your project as you would like it to be—or how your corporate marketing department would like it to be seen— rather than how it actually is.
Particularly, project leaders frequently make the mistake of attempting to make the project appear more democratic than it actually is, in documentation.
This falls apart when users or contributors expect your project to live up to its governance documentation, and it doesn&#8217;t.
People who would have been fine with being told a project was single-company at the outset become very upset if they ask for their committer status and are refused later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like technical documentation, governance documentation should explain how things actually work.
If there are aspirational goals, those go in their own section under "Roadmap" or "TODO."</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_defining_roles">4.9.2. Defining roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, your project will have a variety of real roles, but you only need to define a handful of them to start out.  Those basic Roles are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Member</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leader</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether or not you&#8217;ve thought about it, your project already features all these roles you already have in your project.
Each one of them should be recorded in a roles document of some kind, either in your project&#8217;s documentation or your main source code repository.
This allows you to make what was implicit, explicit, both setting expectations, and allowing more people to participate in your project.
For each role, you&#8217;ll need to define who they are, how they qualify for that role, what they are expected to do, and what their rights and privileges are.
Eventually you&#8217;ll go beyond these roles and define many more specific ones.
But detailing these three will take your project a fair ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_members">Members</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is possibly the least-documented role across all of open source, despite being the most pervasive.
Members are the people or organizations who participate in your project and are recognized for it.
Depending on how your project is run, these can be subscribers on a mailing list, sponsoring companies, known end-users, participants at an event, or members of a foundation.
In some projects, "member" is synonymous with "contributor," but in most this is not the case.
Most projects have a much larger cadre of people who are "involved" with the project in some way but are not actively contributing to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defining who members are requires deciding who the project is actually serving, which is always a critical discussion to have.
Are customers of the main sponsoring company automatically project members?  Can companies be members, or only individuals?
Are end-users members or just contributors?
More than anything, defining Members means defining who it is that project leades need to listen to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For almost all projects, you need to specify what rules members are subject to (usually a code of conduct and not much else) and what they can expect from leaders and contributors.
It&#8217;s particularly helpful to explain how members should participate in the project, such as "members file bugs against this repository, and use the 'new bug' template."
Most people, given clear instructions, are happy to channel their participation into the routes you show them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In projects with democratically elected leadership, members can be a much more rigorously defined role, because being a member can come with voting rights.
This requires you to more carefully qualify members to avoid vote-packing or simply derailing election procedures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_contributors">Contributors</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Far more projects have a written definition of Contributors, but fewer than you&#8217;d think.
It&#8217;s often assumed, in the age of publicly hosted source code control, that you simply count up anyone who shows up in the Github or Gitlab statistics is therefore a Contributor.
But defining "who is a Contributor to this project" can be deceptively hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is it anyone who posted on a mailing list, or do you need 100 merged pull requests?
Is it just code contributors, or contributors of any kind? What about folks who do events and advocacy?
Are staff who work for a contributing company automatically considered contributors, or do they have to earn it individually?
What about someone who contributed a lot of code three years ago, but not since then?
Who gets listed in your release credits and how?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conversation around this will often have a greater effect on your project than the document does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "controubutor" role is also one for which you&#8217;ll need to set many more expectations for what contributors receive in return for their work.
This not only includes an explanation of the intellectual property rules of the project (e.g. does the contributor still own their code, or not), but also questions like how soon a contributor can expect their submissions to be reviewed and accepted or rejected.
Generally, you should also explain how the contributor will be credited for their participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also a place where you set out clearly what rules contributors need to follow.
For example, many projects require contributors or their employers to sign paperwork officially sharing their copyright or other intellectual property (see below for more on this).
You may also require contributors to do certain things to help maintain the project, such as review others' submissions or help with documentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_leaders">Leaders</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we noted, every project has leadership, even those leaders are not clearly identified.
As such, at a minimum you&#8217;ll need to identify who your leaders are, so that decision-making processes can be clear.
Many projects also explain the qualifications and procedure to become a leader, whether it&#8217;s selection by a committee, election, or simply based on your job. If you have a more politically sophisticated project, then those should be written down in a selection/election procedure document as well (see below), but if it&#8217;s simple, selection can just be part of the role document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What fewer projects put into their leadership role documents is the other parts: the powers and limitations of the leaders, their duties, and how people leave the role (voluntary or not).
It&#8217;s very important that everyone know exactly how far a leader&#8217;s authority extends, as well as what they&#8217;re responsible for, or you end up with a lot of conflict between leaders and other project members.
Having a set of written duties helps immensely when your leadership team has to decide to kick out a project leader who has stopped participating, but does not want to resign.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project is trying to recruit new/additional leaders, then it&#8217;s also important to have a detailed set of qualifications a leader needs to meet.
Contrary to some expectations, having detailed qualifications gives people who want to move up in the project a target to shoot for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting policies and procedures</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to some basic role documentation, there&#8217;s a certain amount of basic paperwork that each project should create for itself.
These "policy and procedure" (P&amp;P) documents are considered a kind of minimum for what you need to grow and mature a project.
Your project may, and eventually will, have others as your contributor base expands and the number of processes you need to write down with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these will be mostly technical (like release process, or a support policy), and we won&#8217;t be exploring those here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are three governance P&amp;P that every project should have:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Code of conduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribution process &amp; paperwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication information</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects that grow larger and more popular, become commercially adopted, or are actively recruiting many new contributors probably want some additional P&amp;P docs, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Leadership selection/election process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributor promotion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security issue reporting &amp; handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project trademark usage</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about these six documents below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_developing_a_code_of_conduct">Developing a code of conduct</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a code of conduct (CoC) for your open source community is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to begin influencing the project&#8217;s governance model.
A code of conduct is a description of expectations for community members' behavior when they act within or on behalf of the project.
It might outline the values a community agrees to uphold, articulate the behaviors community members expect one another to exhibit in the service of those values, and identify the consequences of violating the code.
The most effective codes of conduct are those written through collaborative processes that involve participants across the community (not just project leadership!).
In this way, constructing a code of conduct can become a compelling community-building exercise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are the core items that every Code of Conduct needs to have:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A statement of what kind of behavior is encouraged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement of what kinds of behavior are prohibited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact information for reporting violations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the enforcement mechanism</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re starting out, both the report recipients and the enforcers of the CoC are likely to be your project founders.
As your project grows, you&#8217;ll want to form a specific CoC committee, but you don&#8217;t need that right away.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_contribution_process">4.9.3. Contribution process</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to recruit contributors, you need to tell them the basics of how to contribute to your project.
For projects on Github or Gitlab this is generally placed in a document called CONTRIBUTING.md, but it can really go anywhere as long as it&#8217;s linked from your project&#8217;s home page.
If you&#8217;ve documented your "contributor" role, you can just use that for your contribution docs.
If you haven&#8217;t, then here&#8217;s a few things you should cover in your contribution document:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Where to communicate with other contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to submit your first code, documentation, or other contribution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any testing or formatting requirements, in detail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to expect from the review process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they qualify for membership/contributor status</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects have paperwork that needs to be submitted before any contributions can be accepted, such as a Developer Certificate or Origin (DCO) or Contributor License Agreement (CLA), certificate of identity, or GPG keyring.
Spell these out with step-by-step instructions in your contribution document.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_communications">Communications</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most open source projects have multiple ways that project members talk to each other, including email, chat, issues, code reviews, video conferencing, and even in-person meetings.
You need to spell out which channels your project uses, and how to join them.
It&#8217;s also important to keep this information up to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have them, it&#8217;s useful to list both your user forums as well as the channels used for contributors, so that people know where to take their questions.
Distinguish the media used for official project business as opposed to unofficial channels used for general discussion.
It&#8217;s extremely frustrating for contributors to be told "oh, we decided that on the mailing list" if they didn&#8217;t even know there was a mailing list.
Any regular meetings should link to a calendar, or at least information about the next meeting.
And if your community has any important events, such as annual developer conference, mention it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See this guidebook&#8217;s chapter on communication norms in open source projects for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_leadership_selectionelection">Leadership selection/election</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve already documented your "leadership" role, the information on how project members become leaders will be part of it.
However, some projects don&#8217;t get around to writing roles, and other projects have multi-step election procedures that require additional documentation.
Some just want a quick-reference of how the election or selection process works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have the typical new small project, this document will be very short indeed, containing simply the list of project leaders, who are also the project founders.
If your project has a self-appointing council, it&#8217;s not that much more complicated; just write down how the selection works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects that have full-blown elections will need a longer document containing all of the provisions of elections, including who gets to vote, how the vote is conducted and by whom, what the schedule is, and how candidates are selected.
We&#8217;ll offer additional advice on holding elections at the conclusion of this chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_contributor_promotion">Contributor promotion</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project has multiple levels of contributor status, with a defined progression between them—what&#8217;s known as a "contributor ladder"—then it can be useful to write a specific document explaining how this works.
This will give new contributors an idea of what&#8217;s ahead of them and what they need to do to move up.
It also helps make sure that contributor promotion is being done fairly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For fairness, it&#8217;s preferable to make the promotion rules as objective as possible.
For example, "Has consistently helped with code reviews in the subproject" is good, but "Has completed at least 40 code reviews over the last 3 months in the subproject" is better.
Quantifiable rules help you avoid overlooking contributors who are valuable, but not outspoken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smaller projects, with only a couple of contributor levels (e.g. "contributor" and "owner"), do not need a separate document for this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_release_process">Release process</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Releasing software involves making decisions around what will and won&#8217;t be included in the current release.
When a project is small, this is pretty obvious, but in larger projects with contributors working for multiple employers, deciding what stays and what gets cut can be political.
Decisions about which platforms are supported can also be contentious.
As such, when your project grows you&#8217;re going to want to write down some process around releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects have defined release teams, in which case this document will be largely a collection of Role documents for the release team.
In other projects, the maintainers do the releases, but even with those it&#8217;s worthwhile to explain how they decide what gets included.
This doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily changing how you do releases, but rather just writing down what the real procedure already is, particularly the method of deciding which features and patches get left out.
The process for writing and editing the announcement is also worthwhile, especially if your project involves multiple vendors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document will also have lots of non-governance content, like the locations of the servers, the commands to build packages, and how long to wait for mirrors to sync.
It&#8217;s expected that most of it will be technical instructions.
Just don&#8217;t neglect the who and why along with the how.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_security_issue_reporting_handling">Security issue reporting &amp; handling</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once your project&#8217;s code is being used in production by external users, managing security issue reports becomes a critical priority.
While this topic could use an entire chapter on its own, there is some basic governance setup associated with handling security issues.
This will include:
. Who is selected to be on the security team, how, and when.
. Where security reports get sent
. How they are handled, including confidentiality requirements
. What reciprocation security researchers can expect
. How long you can wait before disclosing</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Confidentiality requirements are particularly important for both the security team itself, and for the programmers and security researchers you work with.
For example, security researchers are willing to not disclose their findings to the public until your project does, but only if they are promised that your security team won&#8217;t do that either.
In many projects, security team members aren&#8217;t allowed to share certain information even with their own employers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_project_trademark_usage">Project trademark usage</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a project gets popular, both commercial and non-commercial groups want to use the project&#8217;s name, word mark, and graphical logo in things.
Whether it&#8217;s just statements of support, a third party wanting to sell shirts with your project on them, or other projects that derive from yours, projects need these entities to be following some kind of official policy around usage.
Even if the project has not filed for a trademark with any government yet, establishing a pattern of policy and permission will help protect your project&#8217;s name in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such a policy consists of four things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A general statement of acceptable usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact information to request specific permission or for clarification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A designated team, committee, or contributor who is going to handle these requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional guidelines for the trademark team</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the actual acceptable usage statement and guidelines, projects should obtain legal assistance.
The governance part of this is selecting the "trademark team" (which could be an existing steering council, or similar), and how guidelines are updated and changed.
In projects run by multiple technology vendors, it&#8217;s critical to work this out in the early stages of the project, because the project&#8217;s own sponsors will want to use it&#8217;s mark almost immediately.
Make sure that responsibility here is shared between the stakeholders in your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like security issues, the trademark team needs to be able to handle confidential contacts, because sometimes pre-release startups may want to use your project name.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_holding_community_elections">4.9.4. Holding community elections</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As community projects grow, many choose to select community representatives.
This process may occur when a community loses a founder, a group decides to move to a "ruling technical council" governance model, or when a project moves to a non-profit governing body with paying members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the circumstances, many projects opt to select their community representatives through elections.
Historically, choosing a voting system, defining an electorate, and limiting the pool of eligible candidates has proven complicated for community projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section summarizes project election best practices, including who gets to vote, who can be a candidate, and how elections are run.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_electorate_and_eligible_candidate_pool">Electorate and eligible candidate pool</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Establishing franchise rules is critical.
Some projects have allowed anyone registered for a project&#8217;s site to vote in an election—a very low bar—but have specified that only project committers could be election candidates—a high bar.
However, almost all projects eventually broaden the pool of potential candidates to equal the pool of voters.
Anyone who can vote in the election is therefore eligible to become a candidate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects typically take one of three approaches to defining the electorate and candidate pools:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>High bar:</strong> Voters are members of an inside group—such as committers, maintainers, and core contributors.
Membership requires a long history of participation and seniority recognized by peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium bar:</strong> Active participants or foundation members can vote, as long as they meet a clearly articulated definition of participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low bar:</strong> Anyone can vote as long as they complete some basic steps, like signing up to the program or joining the mailing list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defining an activity metric and minimum bar specifying what qualifies as "participation" can become contentious, mainly because it involves drawing arbitrary lines delimiting eligible participants.
Generally, projects specify that quantified, ongoing participation is necessary to become part of the electorate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One common election fear is ballot stuffing or cohort effects, where large companies dominate the representative bodies by having a large voting bloc, or where friends of candidates will pass the low bar to become voters simply to vote for their candidate.
In most cases, however, such fears are unfounded.
Technical communities often try to create rules to mitigate against possible abuses of the system, but in most cases, these rules are "premature optimization," which Donald Knuth, author of <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>, has famously described as "the root of all evil."<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>
Avoiding special rules—and addressing issues with the electoral process as they arise—is generally the better practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final consideration is the process for becoming a candidate in the election.
The most popular option is self-nomination, where candidates post election information and their reasons for running.
Another option is nomination,which is often the same as self-nomination as the candidate typically asks people to nominate them and second their nomination.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_voting_system">Voting system</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another complex community decision is the voting system.
Any community will include people passionate about how to vote—and how to count votes.
Without proper care, conversations about these issues can go on for months and result in proposals that are almost impossible to implement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most community projects have used:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Voting by secret ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online voting, with a personal token to ensure each person may only vote once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some form of preferential voting, listing candidates in order of preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single transferable vote</a> (STV) to count the votes and identify winners</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects continue to use alternative voting systems like "first past the post" or weighted voting systems, in which voters receive 12 tokens to allocate to candidates however they wish, and the candidates with the most tokens win the election.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several projects use online counting software.
Options to consider include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/">Condorcet Internet Voting Service</a>, a free, online voting and Condorcet counting system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.opavote.com/">OpaVote</a> (formerly OpenSTV), a commercial election counting Software-as-a-Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/openstv">OpenSTV</a>, formerly available under the General Public License (GPL) and still used by several projects to count elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/">Helios</a>, another free election service that allows online voting and several different vote counting methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_how_to_start">How to start</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are planning to propose an election system, begin with a mission statement.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to ensure the technical steering committee represents everyone contributing actively to the project, valuing non-code contributions equally to code contributions, in the definition of the technical scope and direction of the project.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mission statement clarifies several things: who is being represented by the elected body, what their authority will be, and why they are being elected.
Once you have agreed on the goal of the elected body, choose the simplest ways to define membership in the body being represented.
Then, choose the simplest voting and counting system possible.</p>

<h3 id="_introduction_4">5.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mere months after the COVID-19 pandemic forced most tech teams to work remotely or not at all, the murder of George Floyd ignited a racial reconciliation movement.
This movement hit the tech sector especially hard. When Pinterest released a statement supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, two Black women who formerly worked there quickly called out their hypocrisy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first glance, open source seems immune to the multi-pronged problems with diversity and inclusion plaguing digital technology companies.
Open source ecosystems operate online; contributors work across countries, languages, and timezones to power projects that drive the web forward.
In somec cases, people contribute purely out of love for these projects, not for free beer and stock.
Given the prevalence of such altruistic intent, the thinking goes, open source is a true meritocracy, a space where all can thrive regardless of their pronouns.
But if there&#8217;s one thing that industry advocates love more than meritocracy, it&#8217;s data.
And when data show who contributes to the open source ecosystem, they paint a damning picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter offers an overview of open source communities' efforts to make projects more diverse and inclusive.
It also offers initial steps open source community managers and project maintainers can take to begin building communities and projects that benefit from a diverse contributor base.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_state_of_open_source_diversity">5.2. The state of open source diversity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 28.7% of total employed managers in the "Computer and Information Systems" sector <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm">were women</a>.
Of the total employed, 9.6% were Black or African American, 15.8% were Asian, and and 4.7% were Hispanic or Latino.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As these surveys indicate, the digital technology industry is overwhelmingly White and male; open source communities are even more so.
A 2017 GitHub survey of 5,500 open source users and developers found that 95% of randomly selected respondents identified as male.
Three percent identified as women, and 1% as non-binary.
Far from being meritocracies, open source projects are much less likely to see contributions from minorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does this continue to happen?
Recent years have seen an influx of diversity and inclusive (D&amp;I) initiatives aimed at recruiting more diverse project contributors.
The Linux Foundation has devoted an entire section of programming at its annual Open Source Summits purely to sessions on D&amp;I.
DrupalCon offers scholarships for attendees and speakers of minority status.
Several mainstage keynotes at All Things Open 2019 discussed diversity.
With so much attention from community leaders, why do contributor data still paint such a damning picture?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Relative lack of open source activity from women and under-represented minorities (URMs) seems surprising at first, but a closer look reveals some persistent problems regarding inclusion in open source communities. Inclusion is often used as a synonym for diversity; in fact, it is its own principle. To quote Meg Bolger, "Inclusion is about folks with different identities feeling and/or being valued, leveraged, and welcomed within a given setting (e.g., your team, workplace, or industry)." There are some persistent, systemic barriers that keep women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) from being included in open source communities. Without addressing and rectifying these systemic problems, diversity in open source won&#8217;t improve</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack three of those barriers: lack of free time to contribute, a hostile online environment, and lackluster documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_lack_of_time_to_contribute_for_free">5.2.1. Lack of time to contribute for free</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Women and URMs continue <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/an-economist-explains-why-women-get-paid-less/">to earn less</a> than White men for performing the same professional roles.
They are also increasingly likely to be their homes' primary earners, and they&#8217;re more likely to do unpaid labor in the form of housework, childcare, and <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/csw61/redistribute-unpaid-work">other domestic tasks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, they have less spare time to do even more unpaid work by contributing to open source.
When they do make those contributions, they often do so during work hours—because they already work for organizations that let them do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nisha Kumar (She/They) is the technical lead for container build, packaging, and distribution at the Open Source Technology Center at VMware.
She also serves as co-maintainer for the Tern project, and a contributor to the SPDX and OCI communities.
She juggles these projects with her role as primary caregiver to her two-year-old child.
To Kumar, these dual roles are nothing new; as a girl growing up in India, she balanced schoolwork with chores, running errands, and caring for family members.
These endless tasks left no time for her to pursue passion projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If not for her ability to work on open source during the day at VMWare, she&#8217;s unsure if she could contribute today. As she told me:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As a woman in tech contributing to open source in my day job and getting compensated for it, I find that I still don&#8217;t have the time to contribute to open source projects I am personally interested in or even volunteer for my local open source communities because I need to also take care of my child and household."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_hostile_online_environment">5.2.2. A hostile online environment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Internet is not an equally hospitable place.
Women, people of color, and LBGTQ+ people are disproportionately targeted for online harassment, with women twice as likely to <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/06/youre-not-powerless-in-the-face-of-online-harassment">experience online sexual harassment</a> as men.
And these data were collected pre-2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This year&#8217;s confluence of a global pandemic and mass civil unrest has led to increased attacks against people of color, specifically Asian Americans and Black Americans.
If attackers feel emboldened to hurt people in the flesh, it&#8217;s no surprise that this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/business/media/tucker-carlson-writer-blake-neff.html">occurs online</a> as well.
If you work on OS projects with Black and Asian contributors, make no mistake: They are in pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I don&#8217;t see any acknowledgement that the Internet, in general, is mostly inhabited by white men who are hostile to women and URMs," Kumar says.
"How would anyone expect folks who are in general harassed on the internet to suddenly trust an open source community to not behave the same way towards them, despite what its Code of Conduct document says?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kumar&#8217;s concerns are well-founded.
Open source doesn&#8217;t have a reputation for making most feel welcome.
For years, project maintainers have written calls for help, saying they "feel drained, unappreciated, and even abused" on their worst days.
A 2017 survey of 6,000 GitHub contributors found that 21% left projects they were working on after experiencing negative behavior.
With the odds of such behavior that much higher for minorities, it&#8217;s surprising they contribute to open source at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Any time that I spend contributing to [open source] is time I could also be spending volunteering to advance LGBTQ equality, fighting against police brutality, and other issues that I care about, and that disproportionally affect underrepresented people—in fact, it&#8217;s what makes us underrepresented in the first place," explains Perry Eising (He/They), who works as a community manager at a for-profit tech company that hosts open source projects.
"It&#8217;s challenging to justify to myself to spend time being involved in (sometimes hostile feeling) OS and tech debates when I have so many causes that require my attention and efforts."</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_incomplete_inadequate_documentation">5.2.3. Incomplete, inadequate documentation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The barriers above manifest in perhaps the biggest of all: open source projects' lack of documentation.
Quantitative data and qualitative interviews repeatedly share that most open source projects don&#8217;t prioritize or reward documentation.
As a result, outsiders often have no clue how to help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I speak from personal experience here. After speaking at the Open Source Summit in Vancouver two years ago, I found the community so warm and welcoming that I resolved to find a project with which I could help.
Given my background as a writer of all stripes, I thought writing documentation would be the perfect place to start and make a meaningful impact.
So you can imagine how my face fell when I created my first GitHub account, logged onto the platform, and was left totally lost by where to go next.
With no knowledge of how to fork, merge branches, or make pull requests, I had no clue where to start—and knew the margin for error was high.
I&#8217;m fortunate to live in a city with an active tech community that hosts regular meetups for techies of all interests, including tutorials aimed at beginners.
I made my first pull request in person at a conference, and then made most of my first several dozen GitHub contributions at in-person events.
Only after attending multiple free, accessible events over several months did I begin contributing independently.
Absent any of these privileges, I would not have spent hours alone trying to learn how GitHub works to make a PR that might or might not get accepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same GitHub survey that found one in five open source contributors leave projects due to bad behavior also found that incomplete or confusing documentation was the biggest challenge.
93% of that survey’s respondents said they had encountered the problem, yet 60% said they rarely or never contributed to documentation.
As a result, it&#8217;s hard for project veterans to read their projects' docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine how this makes outsiders feel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Contributing to open source is not only a technical challenge but equally a social challenge," explains Nuritzi Sanchez (She/Her), a senior open source program manager at GitLab.
"Documentation is needed to enable remote asynchronous collaboration, which is how communities work.
If everything is stuck inside of people’s heads, that’s going to create an atmosphere of confusion, frustration, and inefficiency."
Documentation isn&#8217;t just essential for code; it&#8217;s also a guide to understand each project&#8217;s cultural and communication norms (see this guidebook&#8217;s chapter on communication norms for more on this subject).
Open source communities use asynchronous communication to work cohesively across disparate time zones.
Without clear documentation, prospective contributors won&#8217;t know how decisions are made, where to contribute to the project, how teams collaborate, or why it&#8217;s important to follow certain processes.
For prospective contributors who are non-native English speakers and/or have special needs, this lack of documentation makes contributing all but impossible.
Inadequate documentation has far-reaching consequences.
It shows a lack of transparency that wastes time, sows distrust, and prevents many open source communities from reaching their full potential.</p>

<h3 id="_tips_to_build_more_inclusive_projects_and_communities">5.3. Tips to build more inclusive projects and communities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite these barriers to entry, there&#8217;s good news for maintainers: You hold enormous power to improve your project&#8217;s culture by making it more inclusive.
Community members, especially those of minority status, have discussed the lack of diversity and inclusion for years.
Now, it&#8217;s time for project maintainers to act by weaving inclusion throughout their project strategies - not making it an afterthought years later.
"[Diversity and inclusion] keynotes might have lofty ideals designed to raise awareness and some might even argue that they were useful at one point (maybe), but we&#8217;ve moved beyond that," argues Lisa-Marie Namphy [She/Her], who runs Cloud Native Containers, the world&#8217;s largest Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) user group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Our communities are saying that it&#8217;s time to act! And action means a change of policies, fund initiatives, quotas, so many things.
The communities are asking for accountability, from the foundations who run them to the corporations who fund them."
If creating an inclusive community sounds overwhelming, remember that the community wants to help.
If you&#8217;re a project maintainer yourself, you don&#8217;t have to do this work alone.
In fact, taking the steps below with a trusted team will help improve your project for all.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_1_stop_saying_youre_a_meritocracy">5.3.1. 1. Stop saying you&#8217;re a meritocracy</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step to a more inclusive open source project involves bursting the meritocracy bubble: The more you believe in meritocracy, the more biased your project is <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/blog/diversity-inclusion-blog/2019/meritocracy-unraveling-paradox.html">likely to be</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why? Purely meritocratic projects <a href="https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/paradox-meritocracy-organizations">don&#8217;t acknowledge</a> that people enter on unequal playing fields.
If an open source maintainer isn&#8217;t aware that women often  have less time to contribute, or that LGBTQ+ contributors are more likely to endure online abuse, they won&#8217;t take steps to make the community more inclusive.
As a result, they risk losing the diverse contributors they worked hard to recruit.
Terri Oda (She/Her) volunteers for the Python Software Foundation and Google&#8217;s Summer of Code alongside her role as an open source security researcher at Intel.
She says claims of meritocracy make her cringe.
Why?
Such statements cause maintainers to ignore opportunities to get more people involved in projects, even in cases where the open source community gathers in person.
"For example, say you&#8217;re running code sprints at a conference and want to increase the number of women," Oda says.
"If you&#8217;re thinking about merit and skills, you&#8217;re going to wind up offering more intro-to-sprinting type content or whining about the university pipeline.
But if you look at the bigger picture, you might realize that the conference offers childcare during the main conference, but it stops when sprints start.
Or that the venue isn&#8217;t in a safe area and the sprints run until after dark."
The first step to build a more inclusive environment is self-awareness.
Open source contributors enter projects with a range of lived experiences that affect how—and if—they show up.
Sitting with and reflecting on this fact is the first, most crucial step.
The next step is to take an honest look at your project&#8217;s current community, and take note of who is—and isn&#8217;t—there.
If your project contributors all, or even mostly, look like you, that&#8217;s a huge red flag that an inclusive overhaul is in order.</p>

<h4 id="_2_prioritize_your_projects_documentation">5.3.2. 2. Prioritize your project&#8217;s documentation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 2019 Stack Overflow study found that about 41% of developers have less than five years of experience.
Between these young technologists and current emphasis on STEM education, there are lots of opportunities to welcome new OS contributors.
In order to do so, project maintainers must lower barriers to entry - and clear, concise documentation is the first step.
Zach Corleissen (he/they) is the lead technical writer for The Linux Foundation (LF) who recently revised a large architectural document for the LF Energy Foundation. He also serves as one of the co-chairs for the Kubernetes documentation special interest group (SIG Docs). Kubernetes was his first OSS project, and it quickly became one of the most prolific projects in modern open source. Its rapid growth allowed Corleissen to own important aspects of its documentation, and revise it to become more reader-friendly.
"Insisting that code is self-documenting is a form of gatekeeping [and] an example of an unhealthy project culture," Corleissen says.
"I think the devaluation often comes from developers who see a static generator stack and think, 'How hard can it be?'
One of my least favorite dismissive phrases: 'It&#8217;s just a pile of Markdown.'
If only it were that easy!
Documentation is code for an environment where no chipsets are identical; kernel defaults are hostile; RAM is variable; storage is subject to random external dependencies; and production regularly fails despite optimal conditions, or inversely, succeeds in spite of obvious CI failures."
To track progress, the SIG Docs group does a quarterly review where they measure the progress of their previous quarter&#8217;s goals and prioritize work for the upcoming quarter.
One of their community rules centers on ownership: In order to adopt a goal, a project needs a specific person willing to drive it.
That creates even more onus on contributors to find new contributors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_3_create_and_enforce_a_clear_code_of_conduct">5.3.3. 3. Create and enforce a clear Code of Conduct</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project doesn&#8217;t already have a Code of Conduct (CoC), it&#8217;s never too late to make one (see this guidebook&#8217;s chapter on governance for tips of getting started).
They are an expectation for modern open source initiatives, from long-term projects to two-day conferences.
In my own research for this chapter, several open source contributors said they won&#8217;t consider joining new projects that lack clear CoCs; for these URMs, the risk of joining an unwelcoming if not hostile community is too high.
"Having a code of conduct would be big for me," explains Natalie Zamani (She/Her), Senior Software Engineer at Apple.
"And then something as seemingly unrelated as not tolerating project contributors espousing racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic ideas, even if it’s not related to their project work.
I wouldn’t feel comfortable working with individuals who hold such views, full stop. And I’ve seen a few projects that would otherwise be interesting to me where that’s tolerated."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the former President and Chairperson of the Board of Directors for the GNOME Foundation, Sanchez helped create GNOME&#8217;s event CoC.
She says that while the Contributor’s Covenant is the default Code of Conduct for a lot of OS communities, translating it to an events format took some creative work—and a lot of feedback from the GNOME community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"No matter the type of CoC you’re rolling out, having a transparent plan and timeline is key," Sanchez says.
"At GNOME, we created a working group after one of our annual conferences to start drafting a code of conduct.
We passed the notion of a working group by the Board of Directors to make sure that they were onboard.
They made a community-wide announcement letting people know the process: a working group would be drafting the CoC, sending to community for revisions, the Board would then see the revised draft and vote, and then the membership would vote at the Annual General Meeting."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the key role of community feedback, Sanchez says the CoC should be owned by a governing body within your project.
CoCs remain a touchy subject in open source communities, and not all open source contributors believe they&#8217;re necessary.
A governing body (or at least a committee) comprised of diverse contributors and shares the creation process can help alleviate disagreements.
Once you&#8217;ve created your governing body, assign members to own specific tasks.
These include a Chair who can break voter ties, moderators to enforce the Code of Conduct, and mentors to train the community.
It&#8217;s essential for all community members—especially URMs—to see that project leads protect their safety and integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I am a firm believer that signalling is very important, but that broken trust is difficult to repair," Eising explains.
"Don&#8217;t signal to minorities that you are ready to embrace them before you actually are—that&#8217;s like inviting someone who uses a wheelchair to a party on the first floor with no elevator.
That person won&#8217;t trust you again to think about your needs appropriately.
Organizations need to look within and really assess before making a reach out."</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_4_reward_contributions_beyond_code">5.3.4. 4. Reward contributions beyond code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In her time working on open source, Sanchez says that most projects focus on attracting a narrow set of contributors: Engineering, Design, Translation, Documentation, and Outreach. Despite how broad that sounds, she&#8217;d like to see a lot more roles and contributions be rewarded:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Career Development Target
Teams within OSS orgs to check out
Why
Sales / Business Development
Fundraising, partnerships
Both of these things require you to pitch the value of the open source  community / project and require you to develop your communication and negotiation skills, among other things
Marketing
engagement, marketing, or outreach teams
Some projects may not even have this set up and are in need of someone to help! Even if you don’t have a lot of experience in this, you may have more experience than anyone else in that community and it’s your chance to build something from scratch. This could look really amazing on a resume!
Strategy
Board of Directors / governance team, community team
It depends a bit on the maturity of the organization, but typically there’s a lot of room for building your strategy skills when on the board of Directors. You have a birds-eye view of the project, typically have say over project finances, and can help define goals and move the project forward at a whole new level. Since you can’t get there right away, leading initiatives can help you build those skills and there’s often a lot of room for people to step in and own big chunks on OSS community teams
Data Science
Community team, Board of Directors
What kind of data is being collected to ensure that initiatives are successful? Measuring a community’s health is something that more and more people are interested in and there’s a need for data heads to help
Graphic Design
marketing team, technical projects
There’s a lot of need for graphic design for brand and marketing initiatives, and in general to help make the project more mature. Some projects may not even have established brand guidelines, and there’s a big need for more designers in general
Project Management / Program Management
engagement, marketing, outreach, documentation, community teams
There is a huge need for highly organized people who can create processes and structure. Many initiatives fall to the side because there isn’t someone to help push it along and make it happen
Product Management
any technical project, new initiatives, website, newcomers initiatives
Product management is essential at companies, and yet it’s something that isn’t always easily found within OSS. There’s a lot of room for PMs to jump in to help create more innovative products and help bridge the gap between communities and businesses, helping to expand the project’s reach
Legal
Board of Directors, community team
There&#8217;s a growing need for more people who are able to navigate open source related legal matters. Lawyers may get a lot of great experience working on community teams or sitting on the Board of Directors
HR/People
Board of Directors, community team, newcomers initiatives
We need people who care about people and want to make the community awesome.
This helps with newcomers initiatives and lowering the barrier of entry, as well as retention. It also may help the community gain better communication practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This list isn&#8217;t exhaustive, nor is it applicable to all projects.
The goal is to look at your own OS project&#8217;s holistic needs in the short and long terms, then recruit contributors to fill specific gaps.
Doing so allows you to create a governing board with representatives that own specific aspects of the project and contribute to its growth.
Nithya Ruff (She/Her) leads the Open Source Program Office for Comcast and serves as Chair of the Linux Foundation board.
In more than two decades of open source work, she has seen how ignoring crucial skills—including legal issues such as copyrights and trademarks—can keep a project from achieving long-term success. Recruiting and rewarding diverse contributions also plays a key role in preventing burnout, which project maintainers have been increasingly vocal about.
"It is unfair to expect the maintainer or the developer who started the project or leads the project to care for all of these issues, [or] have the skills to do it," Ruff says.
"All forms of contribution need to be valued [because this] brings diversity of people into the project, which makes the project more vibrant and innovative.
Foundations like the Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation bring all of these contributions to the table for their hosted projects.
This allows the project to more successfully build a broader ecosystem."</p>

<h4 id="_5_mentor_new_talent_to_grow_and_lead_the_project">5.3.5. 5. Mentor new talent to grow and lead the project</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eleven years after co-founding Redis, Salvatore Sanfilippo announced plans to step down as project maintainer of the NoSQL database.
He named Yossi Gottlieb and Oran Agra as his successors to maintain the Redis project.
In doing so, the Redis governance model got a refresh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than keeping Redis&#8217;s prior BDFL style, Gottlieb and Agra built a new, lighter governance model.
It involves electing a small group of longtime Redis developers to act as core contributors and uphold the project&#8217;s Code of Conduct.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of your own project&#8217;s governance model, you must include a way to train key contributors to assume leadership roles.
This achieves three key goals:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Helping new contributors learn how they can grow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewarding contributors who own key aspects of the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing maintainer burnout</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This last point is noteworthy: Sanfilippo said when he stepped down from Redis that despite his passion for coding, he never aspired to maintain a project.
Without new leaders to step up—and documentation sharing how contributors can assume such roles—maintainers risk either working on projects when they no longer want to or having the project stall.
Likewise, the project risks depriving others of the chance to step up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The act of building and maintaining a mentorship program is inclusive in itself.
Several open source leaders interviewed for this book said they see a clear need for more mentorship in open source at large, and a desire to do it themselves.
In some cases, open source contributors believe so much in the power of mentorship that they restructured their contributions to include it.
And, because they were mindful of their own time limitations, they offered flexibility to new leaders as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"My open source contributions definitely changed even before I became a parent," explains Oda.
"As the coordinator for a global mentoring program that happens in the summer, I had to plan some years ahead to build a volunteer team that could do everything I do. So, I handed off some of my other projects more completely and never went back to them.
"Since new moms typically get less than one hour of free time per day, the key for me has been aligning the open source I want to do with the open source that work wanted to pay me for.
I worked to take CVE Binary Tool open source after I returned from maternity leave, and worked with my boss to make sure I could have time to mentor students as part of my maintainer role."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To build your own mentorship program, Sanchez says to focus on four actions and initiatives:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create learning opportunities often. Find ways to help people learn what you do and how you do it. Don’t just wait for formal internship or mentorship programs, but take advantage of those if you can. Consider recording videos, holding AMAs, participating in events, etc. Be open to communicating with people informally in order to build relationships and trust so that you can help develop those with potential. Cast your net wide and you&#8217;ll probably find those gem contributors who are ready to step in to help bring your project to a whole new level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be a connector. Try to have a mental map of prominent contributors in your community and their strengths. Share the mentorship by introducing newcomers to several people. Burnout is real on the mentor side and you want to make sure that there are other people your mentee can reach if you need to take a break or just get busy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure that there’s a chat tool specifically for community interactions. In order to build trust, people need private spaces. Chat facilitates conversations and collaboration, and also allows people to message you directly. To avoid burnout, you may want to have a chat tool available just for your community / work conversations and a chat tool just for your personal life. That way, you can turn off all notifications on one tool if you need a break, or just simply have that mental separation thanks to differences in UX.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connect through events. Events provide a powerful opportunity for you to connect with potential mentees. At these events, try to plan fun activities that are designed to help people connect informally. This may mean having a people-bingo where people have to ask each other questions to enter a raffle, or it could be a city tour, or a game night. Fun activities throughout the year can facilitate authentic relationships, which can also help people overcome fear of contribution.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_6_commit_to_continuous_improvement">5.3.6. 6. Commit to continuous improvement</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work of inclusion is never done.
It&#8217;s ongoing.
As your project grows, you will find new gaps to fill, questions to document, and additions to the Code of Conduct.
As your community becomes more inclusive, it might feel like you&#8217;re finding more ways you&#8217;ve fallen short.
Uncomfortable as this is, it&#8217;s actually a good thing.
It means you&#8217;ve done the hard work of committing to keep on getting better.
And, if you&#8217;ve done the work of building an inclusive team, you won&#8217;t do this work alone.
Instead, you&#8217;ll share the work with your community, giving everyone the chance to share their feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To keep the dialogue ongoing and open, give your community options to leave feedback on their experiences.
This can range from quarterly surveys to giving contributors the freedom to create channels in your project&#8217;s Slack, Discourse, etc. chat about mental health, being a person of color, how to handle negotiations, etc.
Such channels give contributors ways to connect socially, which is crucial for increasing asynchronous collaboration.
It also gives you new ways to support contributors so they can contribute more fully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I am hearing-impaired, and I requested that the All Things Open Conference consider that when in larger venues where keynotes were speaking and there were no specific adaptations for those of us who were not able to hear," explains Don Watkins (He/Him), a community correspondent for OpenSource.com who has been active in the Linux community for two decades.
"I was particularly impressed when attending the Creative Commons Global Summit in Toronto in 2018, where nearly all presentations were accompanied by folks who signed and also provide simultaneous closed captioning of all speakers."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inclusion isn&#8217;t a one-time pull request, which makes it such an important problem to solve.
Without building and sustaining inclusive communities, there&#8217;s no hope of improving diversity of open source contributors.
To receuit new talent, prevent maintainer burnout, and create affirming online environments, open source maintainers should commit to inclusion.
Change starts from within, and when diverse tech talent sees your inclusive efforts, they will be much more likey to join.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Make it easy for people to get involved and to contribute back," says Ruff.
"The mark of a good project is not how complex it is, but how easy it is to get involved."</p>

<h3 id="_introduction_5">6.2. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of their roles (but also, perhaps, because of their natures), community managers often focus (even fixate) on the health and well-being of their community members and teams.
They understand the challenges and difficulties associated with encouraging stable, safe, and inclusive online communities, places where people demonstrate compassion and empathy.
But too often, they mistakenly assume they&#8217;re immune to the same emotionally difficult challenges they strive to help other community members overcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s more, they may even try to <em>hide</em> their vulnerabilities, for fear of being perceived as less capable of performing their roles—or, worse, being rejected by their communities or peer groups group completely.
This perspective on vulnerability can lead community managers down an isolating road, one that might make them feel as though they aren&#8217;table to reach out to seek help when they need it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet, the longer we don&#8217;t attend to our well being, prolonging treatment for our increasingly negative symptoms, the larger the problem—until, eventually, we are mentally and physically debilitated, suffocated, and denied of the fulfillment and joy our role once provided us.
Regaining that joy could take months, even years.
In fact, we may never regain that same level of passion for them again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help ourselves as community managers, and in turn help others, we need to learn how to spot the signs of dissatistfaction, disillusionment, and burnout.
These signs can be subtle and hard to detect, but by identifying and acknowledging these changes in behavior (first and foremost in yourself), you begin applying similar awareness to others in your communities.
This experience can provide insight to developing and building up social norms and mechanisms for the community to help reduce the occurrence and impact of burnout thus promoting a physically and mentally healthy, more productive community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll explore the importance of self-care and why community managers should be mindful of the interpersonal aspects of the role that may affect them both positively and negatively. This chapter also provides practical steps to encourage and maintain a healthy work life balance that can be applied to themselves and promote within their community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_importance_of_self_care">6.3. The importance of self-care</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What exactly is self-care?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WHO (World Health Organization) defines self-care as:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Self-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider".<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a nutshell, then, self-care is the practice of making conscious, mindful efforts to perform activities that aid in our physical, emotional, relational, and perhaps spiritual well-being at a fundamental level.
Most of us already practice self-care daily by taking actions to protect our overall health (for example, eating healthily, exercising, and getting enough sleep).
Sometimes, however, we may find acts like these alone are insufficient for maintaining our well-being—and that a conscious effort at finding additional support is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can usually handle stress more effectively when we&#8217;re in a happy state in mind.
So by practicing self-care, we can build a resilience to life&#8217;s unavoidable stressors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This concept of self-care may appear simplistic in theory, but it is so commonly overlooked or neglected—especially by community managers.
Let&#8217;s explore (and deconstruct) some reasons why.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_emotional_contagion">6.3.1. Emotional contagion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Community managers are often seen as leaders, the people everyone can turn to, an inspiration for others to emulate.
This seemingly high pedestal can be daunting, demanding a good deal of emotional intelligence and mental effort to deliver a community that&#8217;s not only growing but also productive.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the going gets tough, it&#8217;s often our responsibility (and our desire) to pull the community through those times.
But in order to do this, we need to be in top condition _ ourselves_.
That is, we first need to look after ourselves before we can look after others in any sustainable way.
Otherwise, we&#8217;ll never be able to adequately face whatever is thrown at us (and, when interacting with diverse personalities, resolving conflicts, making tough decisions, and all the while working towards future long term objectives, something always is).
And that is why self-care is so important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the first tasks on the road to self-care, then, is to be aware of how our own emotional states can impact our communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Emotions (both positive and negative) are highly contagious.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>
Our emotional expressions have the power to unconsciously influence people around us, such that others may even begin unconsciously mimicking our own.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_11" title="View footnote.">11</a>]</sup>
If we are in a state of anxiety or stress, others will sense this and add to it their own negative energy.
We see this when dealing with particularly toxic community members infecting others, but fail to identify that we ourselves can unconsciously unduly influence others as well.
Similarly, if we are in a genuine pleasant mood, then people tend to be driven by that positive mood and become more productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short: In order to bring out the best in others we must bring our best to the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As leaders, we wield potentially immense power to make positive changes in our communities.
Let&#8217;s use this power.
Take every opportunity to utilize your influence for encouraging and promoting self-care—not only for the community&#8217;s benefit, but also for yourself.
Educate yourself on what self-care looks like to you, and communicate that understanding with your team.
Community managers don&#8217;t need to share their most intimate fears or anxieties.
Yet simply initiating a conversation on the importance of self-care can be beneficial, not just for the team <em>running</em> the community, but for the <em>entire</em> community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identify and implement regular, dedicated time in your and the team&#8217;s workload to practice self-care.
Set realistic expectations on deliverables and communicate frequently within the team potential triggers of stress or strain that may require more downtime to focus on one&#8217;s physical and mental health.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By taking steps towards actively promoting and advocating for self-care, you prompt members following your lead to do the same. You also begin revealing your human side, eroding the unhealthy addumption that leaders are invulnerable to emotional dimensions of the work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_being_imperfectly_and_empathetically_human">6.3.2. Being (imperfectly and empathetically) human</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can often find ourselves being controlled by unrealistic generalizations (either our own, or others') of what a community manager should be: driven, friendly, successful, super-human, even perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, these impressions of what a leader really "should" be are full of contradictions and fundamentally flawed.
A leader can be many things to many people, but the most important aspect is that they are human: flaws and all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet community managers may tend to over-compensate, attempting to live up to these leadership images—especially by suppressing and hiding negative emotions for fear of being seen as "too emotional" or, worse, "out of control."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there&#8217;s a difference between being <em>in</em> control, being <em>controlled</em>, and being <em>under</em> control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The belief that being "in control" is a reflection of our confidence in what we produce is inaccurate.
It actually demonstrates that we are reluctant to show others that we are not perfect and struggle to accept anything less.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_12" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_12" title="View footnote.">12</a>]</sup>
Although maintaining this front can help shield us temporarily from others' emotions and criticisms towards us, it doesn&#8217;t protect us from our own self-destruction caused by bottling them up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequences of suppressing your emotions will inevitably surface, and dramatically so.
This is when our emotions <em>control us</em> (and our actions), which often leads to rumination, collapse of relationships with one&#8217;s team or community, and other negative outcomes like burnout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ultimate aim is to be "under control," both with your emotions and your workload.
Here, our passion and attention are directed in a constructive and purposeful manner—a particularly important place to be in when we&#8217;ve made a mistake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The phrase "bring your whole self to work" is a good expression of allowing yourself this forgiveness.
We should feel like we can admit when we don&#8217;t know something, haven&#8217;t made the correct decision, or have made a mistake.
And we should also recognize and accept that we can have good days and bad ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being honest with ourselves is as important as being honest with our communities.
If we&#8217;re not honest with ourselves and in tune with our emotional states, we may unintentionally escalate difficult situations within our communities (due to our failures at acknowledging that perhaps <em>we</em> should be stepping back instead).
Of course until we feel we have more clarity to address the situation appropriately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintaining this kind of emotional labor can be incredibly exhausting.
We must acknowledge and accept that being perfect is unattainable, and more importantly, not a requirement for being a great leader.
What <em>is</em> important is that people can relate to your human side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People gravitate to others with whom they share a kinship.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_13" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_13" title="View footnote.">13</a>]</sup>, and being able to identify this feeling of kinship is one hallmark of an effective community manager.
If your members see that you possess qualities they can relate to, they can more easily empathize with you.
Ironically, we often emphasis the significance of practicing empathy for our members or team, but it&#8217;s equally important that our members demonstrate compassion, and gratitude towards us too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As everyone on a team or in a community nurtures this empathy, they will gradually deeper connections and trust between them, which in turn can help them establish an informal social support network.
This network can be a conduit for promoting the importance of self-care, creating judgment-free zones, or providing safe havens to individual members (including yourself) for emotional reflection, airing frustrations, or sharing workloads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is inevitable that some members will expect you to adhere to the pretense of being the all powerful, infallible captain of the ship, but with an effective self-care routine and the backing of the members within this social support network, you&#8217;ll feel more confident in your ability to handle those stressors.
You&#8217;ll also understand that your vulnerabilities are what makes you a better community leader.</p>

<h3 id="_types_of_self_care">6.4. Types of self-care</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everyone will prefer different self-care techniques and strategies, depending on their moods and circumstances.
To be effective, self-care requires regular and conscious cultivation, so it&#8217;s important that we view self-care not only a reactive choice but also as a means of alleviating the stresses of everyday life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, however, a number of different self-care types can satisfy our basic need to promote a healthy and happy mind and body. These are: <strong>physical</strong>, <strong>mental</strong>, <strong>spiritual</strong>, <strong>emotional</strong>, and <strong>social</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll explore each of these types in more detail.
But remember: we should be aiming to practice a <em>selection</em> of activities of <em>all</em> these types if we&#8217;re going to provide ourselves a healthy life balance and respond adequately to all types of stress.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_physical_self_care">6.4.1. Physical self-care</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Physical self-care is usually the self-care we perform at a minimum, often subconsciously: feeding, hydrating, sleeping, and exercising.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, we often find ourselves neglecting these necessities for the sake of work (enduring frequent all-nighters, for example, or forgetting to eat lunch every weekday).
Keeping ourselves nourished helps us maintain bodily health. Getting into healthy physical self-care routines also helps us take regular breaks from our work—and our work <em>environments</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Physical self-care might include activities like:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintaining a regular sleep routine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eating a healthy diet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a nap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting a massage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going for a stroll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stretching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing yoga (or other forms of exercise)</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mental_self_care">6.4.2. Mental Self-Care</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mental self-care is the act of stimulating our mind with positive and purposeful thoughts to help reduce stress levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are doing things that keep the mind engage at an intellectual level on topics that interest you or help de-clutter your thoughts to re-organize them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mental self-care is often less tangible than other types so it can be more difficult to see an immediate benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, with consistency of exercising mental self-care we will see it&#8217;s benefits shape and form healthy attitudes towards others aspects of our life as we will be more inclined to be mentally satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few examples of mental self-care:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reading a new book or article</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try a hobby or interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a list of goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solving puzzles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize or clean out a space in your room</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_spiritual_self_care">6.4.3. Spiritual Self-Care</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This type of self-care often gets wrongly associated with being solely religion but it can be applied to everyone whether you&#8217;re religious, atheist, agnostic, or otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spiritual self-care are activities that nurtures the connection between you and your soul, providing you a deeper sense of meaning, or understanding of the universe.
The word soul is merely a representation of the entity or uniqueness you feel embodies you, this can also be your inner spirit, energy source or another reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few examples of spiritual self-care:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volunteering for a cause you care about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditate</p>

<li>
<p>Spent time in nature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pray or attend religious service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining your most important values or morals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering your significant relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discover new forms of spirituality and religion</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the different types and activities of self-care you perform, the aim is to help us in a constant and sustainable way, to fight off and defend us against the negative effects of our role.
By ignoring our physical and mental well being we will be more likely to succumb to the stress and fatigue leading us towards more dangerous chronic illnesses and syndromes, like burnout.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_burnout">6.5. Burnout</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What exactly is burnout? The WHO (World Health Organization) definition of burnout is:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. ".<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_14" title="View footnote.">14</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Burnout can affect us all and in any occupation, however it seems more prevalent in roles that are mentally and emotionally draining for extended periods of time.
This is common due to the prevailing norms within those roles of being selfless and putting others first.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_15" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_15" title="View footnote.">15</a>]</sup>: going the extra mile to maintain a happy and content environment or atmosphere either for the client or within a community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also appearing more and more within the tech industry.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup>
This increase has been attributed to the seemly accepted 24/7 work mentality and competitiveness of the industry, leading to workers involved in technology, particularly software development, to becoming overwhelmed and mentally exhausted to the point of risking their health.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We should highlight that work related stress and burnout are very different, and in cases some amount of stress can provide a source of motivation but only if it is manageable and for a temporary period of time.
When occupational stress is long occurring, seen as chronic, affecting the overall well being of ourselves, this can develop into the term of burnout.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_look_out_for_symptoms">6.5.1. Look out for symptoms</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Burnout is extremely hard to detect as not only is it subtle and progressive, but it is often misdiagnosed as the earlier, more temporary, common work related stress.
This is because the two are similar until it becomes too late and has developed into a much deeper and harder problem to treat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Psychologist Herbert Freudenberger has released multiple books and articles regarding his research of the possible causes, implications and affects of burnout since the 1970&#8217;s.
His work.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_17" title="View footnote.">17</a>]</sup> has helped to define the different symptoms and thus the phases of experiencing burnout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps you recognize several of them in yourself; perhaps you recognize only one or two.
It&#8217;s not always easy to see the signs since not only do they gradually occur over time, but also hide behind our own denial of something being wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Exhaustion</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Loss of energy and accompanying feelings of weariness are usually the first distress signals especially when, being a community manager, we naturally have high energy levels.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_18" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_18" title="View footnote.">18</a>]</sup>
However, be careful not to push yourself harder if you do find yourself struggling to keep up with your usual round of activities.
Doing so will only exacerbate the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly to our emotions, our energy also affects others around us.
We tend to fuel our energy by achieving our goals and reaping the rewards, thus sharing that with others.
If we are unable to attain rewards due to the lack of energy levels then this feeds into a vicious cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The things that once excited us, like leaving a meeting fired up to accomplish an objective, have now become mundane and seen as excessive use of our already depleting energy.
You may not see the lack of accomplishments, like others do, because you see less and less significance in obtaining the rewards and blame your tiredness on your increasing workload.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Detachment</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We usually demonstrate a sense of detachment or apathy as a self-protective device to help ward off emotional stress or pain.
When we begin to feel let down by situations or those around us, whether that is the team, community, company or even ourselves, we are temped to down play their importance; "I don&#8217;t care, it wasn&#8217;t important anyway" and move away from the things that used to involve us.
By doing so we are depriving them the power to affect us negatively, however, this also blocks their ability to positively affect us.
This can lead to loneliness and isolation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Boredom and Cynicism</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve become more detached from the things that excited you, you find it increasingly hard to remain interested in what&#8217;s going on around you.
You begin to question the value of your activities, your relationships, and perhaps the bigger aspects of your life.
This can lead you to becoming skeptical or even suspicious of other people&#8217;s motives and causes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Impatience and heightened irritability</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People who have high energy levels also usually have a characteristic of being mildly impatient, whether it is with others or with themselves, due to their ability to perform things quickly to then progress onto something else.
However, when experiencing burnout, the perception that we need to over accomplish things and thus so does the impatience to do so.
This impatience can spill out over to others as irritability with everyone around them.
Things that were once trivial and minor become huge obstacles often with the blame pointed at others creating it rather than ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A sense of omnipotence</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t start off feeling this way about our role, but often when we are overwhelmed with our workload we can default to a sentiment "No one else can do this, only I can."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sort of statement is often an attempt to justify the over exertion of the effort and applying value to it whilst other areas of our workload is failing.
That grasp of control when things are becoming out of control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rest assure that indeed others can perform those tasks, though differently and maybe not to the same degree of excellence you may have done but it could be a situation that doesn&#8217;t always require excellence.
This type of egoism is more often a hindrance to progression and the initiative of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A suspicion of being unappreciated</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To counter balance our lack of energy we often increase our effort, but this doesn&#8217;t necessarily reflect good results.
However we don&#8217;t acknowledge this, we only see the effort expended.
We can then begin to feel like we&#8217;re being less appreciated from others in the team or the community as a whole.
"Can&#8217;t they see all the hard work I&#8217;m doing, staying late at night?"
This feeling can lead to being bitter and angry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Paranoia</strong>.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_19" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_19" title="View footnote.">19</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leading from the signs of feeling unappreciated to feeling as though the world is against us.
When things go wrong, but we are unable to understand or see why, we tend to seek out a target, not ourselves, to blame regardless if there is little merit in the accusation.
Often the person labeled as the culprit becomes the target of our frustrations.
This can be team members, friends or even family.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Disorientation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disorientation is when we feel we&#8217;ve become separated from our environment and understanding of what is going on around us.
Discovering yourself in a situation that you didn&#8217;t become aware of or that you previously understood a concept but now do not.
We see ourselves starting to forget things easily and our concentration span deteriorates leading us into more confusion and agitation, fueling the other symptoms like paranoia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Psychosomatic complaints</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not to be misunderstood that implying those experiencing signs of burnout are not feeling physically sick, they can and do.
But it does highlight that with prolong stress physical illness symptoms appear as a secondary symptom to the cause, like linger colds, backache, headaches etc.
Sometimes these illnesses mask the deeper more emotional stress that we feel but we feel more comfortable taking a sick day instead of actually acknowledging the mental stress.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_burnout_cycle">6.5.2. Burnout cycle</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Freudenberger and his colleague Gail North.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_20" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_20" title="View footnote.">20</a>]</sup> later categorized the consequences of these symptoms into 12 phases of one developing burnout syndrome.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_21" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_21" title="View footnote.">21</a>]</sup>.
Similar to the symptoms, sufferers may experience episodes in multiple phases, not in sequential order, and for any length of period of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>A compulsion to prove oneself</strong>: desire to prove oneself, to have impact on one&#8217;s peers, initially seems beneficial until this desire turns into obsession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intensity (Working Harder)</strong>: compulsion becomes misconstrued as dedication and commitment. This can appear as an unwillingness to delegate work, for fear of losing perfect control, or working harder and longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neglecting their needs</strong>: work begins to dominate and subtler duties and pleasures are viewed as unnecessary like sleep, eating healthy, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Displacement of conflicts</strong>: conflict from others are considered meddlesome and seen as a threat. Coping mechanisms are put into place to dismiss problems and these can manifest into physical breakdowns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distortion of Values</strong>: focus on work only, values are distorted as well as relationships. This leads to them being dismissed or abandoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Emerging Problems</strong>: mechanisms to defend oneself against the impact of life and in turn their demands. Develop inability to tolerate ambiguity and become non-receptive; projecting the anxieties and insecurities externally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Withdrawal</strong>: Become detached from our emotions and from other people. Often "escaping" through television, books or other means like alcohol/drugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Odd Behavioral Changes</strong>: friends and family identify increasingly obvious changes in behavior like attitude, language or physical activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depersonalization</strong>: viewing the needs of one self and others are now significantly undervalued and dismissed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inner Emptiness</strong>: feelings of hollowness and uselessness. There is a desire to replenish but are usually quick wins, or false cures and ultimately unfulfilling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depression</strong>: feeling of being hopeless and joyless. Despair and exhaustion are primary feelings and the overwhelming desire to escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Burnout Syndrome</strong>: suicidal thoughts, physical and mental collapse leading to life threatening situations. Immediate professional medical help is imperative.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These distinctions help us to identify the deterioration in either our own, our team&#8217;s or community member&#8217;s activities and their attitudes towards themselves and others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to be self-critical and pierce our disillusion that everything is fine – it usually isn&#8217;t and it won&#8217;t "just work its way out".</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_causes_of_burnout">6.5.3. Causes of burnout</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve identify the devastating affects of burnout now lets explore the possible sources to these symptoms within our role or even within the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We earlier described that burnout is a combination of many factors but a recurring element is the realization, subconsciously or not, that we don&#8217;t feel our work is providing us the same sense of reward and purpose as it had once done before.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_22" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_22" title="View footnote.">22</a>]</sup>
Rewards doesn&#8217;t always equate to money or status but can simply be the deeper satisfaction and pleasure in the adhering to one&#8217;s values and achieving happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Lack of Control</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To feel a sense of accomplishment and ownership of a task, a role requires a suitable level of autonomy to achieve this.
If we have the inability to influence our decisions or don&#8217;t have access to appropriate tools or resources, this can lead to the de-motivating feeling that our work and effort is not being appreciated enough or we are not trusted enough with this responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lack of control can also manifest when dealing with other peoples' emotions.
Although we can encourage and try to direct our members to adhere to our community&#8217;s code of conduct or a preferred course of action in a conflict, we evidently can not remove their willfulness.
We must only pre-empt their next move no matter how disastrous it may be.
This can lead to the feeling of constantly fire fighting and not accomplishing anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Unfairness</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfairness within the role can be viewed as a number of different things that attribute to one&#8217;s feeling powerless or being disrespected.
Either you or others are treated unfairly: office or community politics that creates a culture of favoritism, lack of transparency in the top down decisions, or a disproportionate amount of workload is allocated to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Insufficient Reward</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You feel unappreciated, taken for granted or simply not satisfied in your role.
Rewards don&#8217;t always require to be monetary but often this is the first thing to come under our scrutiny when the workload increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also need social rewards where we gain the recognition from others.
A lack of recognition can be from the our company itself not appreciating our worth: the team&#8217;s lack of respect towards us, or from the community not seeing all the "behind the scenes" activities we perform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intrinsic rewards are also important to maintain a healthy perceptive on our role.
This is where you take the self-acknowledgment of doing a good job and feel accomplished.
When we feel we aren&#8217;t living up to our standards we begin to feel disappointed and become de-motivated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes we feel unsatisfied because we have a conflict of personal values with the company or project we work with.
We are often asked to relay and even promote the decisions of the company to the community and these may not align with our own personal values.
This can be seen as self-betrayal to your morals and build up resentment towards the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Work Overload</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably the most common experience attributing to burnout is the over burdening of one&#8217;s workload.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_23" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_23" title="View footnote.">23</a>]</sup>, whether from our own doing or by someone else.
This can occur when the quantity of work and expectations exceeds the amount of time or resources available.
We often find that most other employees expect work attributed to yourself is "urgent" when in fact they aren&#8217;t.
It&#8217;s important to maintain boundaries and stand your ground to combat an ever increasing list of things to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Lack of Community</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It goes without saying that community is extremely important; its fuels the purpose of the role as a source of motivation and companionship - a sense of belonging to a person.However if this becomes stagnant, overwhelmed with toxic members and feedback is non-existent this can make the job feel stifled.</p>

<p>If you feel yourself or anyone else succumbing to burnout then the most direct approach is to take a break from the source of the stress, which is more often work, and reflect on the more acute causes of your burnout.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_24" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_24" title="View footnote.">24</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1. Use your holiday time</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to utilize this time and don&#8217;t feel guilty either.
Using your holiday does not demerit your dedication to the role, neither does it mean that everything will fall apart whilst away.
Use this time to concentrate on yourself, and what gives you pleasure in life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2. Spend time with those you care about</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Re-kindle your social relationships, they have probably missed you as a result of the developing burnout.
Talk through how you&#8217;re feeling and enjoy your time with them so it is overall a pleasant experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try to generally stay clear of negative people in your life.
This could mean letting them disappear from your social network, or limit your interaction with them.
Remember, other people&#8217;s emotions can affect us both positive and negatively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3. Re-evaluate priorities</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identify what is important to you and reflect upon if your current lifestyle, or work life balance mirrors that.
If they don&#8217;t then priorities what you wish to enjoy more and block out time in your schedule and commit to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also evaluate your options and consider what the next steps would be to resolve the stressors you have.
This could be coming to a solution or compromises with your line manager to reduce workload or other concerns you have.
There may be a point that the only way to remove certain stressors in your life is to leave your job to improve your health.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4. Practice self-care</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take the time to commit yourself fully to what ever self-care activity you want to enjoy and do it.
Try and practice self-care daily, detaching yourself from as much work as possible and devote yourself to some "me" time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>5. Seek professional help</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If all the other options have little or no affect on your physical or mental well being, or you feel you require immediate assistance, then do seek professional help as a matter of urgency.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_work_life_balance">6.6. Work Life Balance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A healthy work life balance is having a clear distinction between our personal and work lives without allowing one to dominate the other. Both are equally important and neither should be undervalued.
We can find ourselves in unhealthy mindsets when forced to be stuck in either one extreme or the other withholding an important sense of purpose and enjoyment from that part of our lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has also become more difficult in this day and age to detach ourselves physically from our work life.
Technology has provided us such a convenience that we are in almost constant connection to it, and thus in connection to our online communities.
It is a common place to check emails at all hours, or respond to members of communities on our social media network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As well as this physical difficulty we may also have the emotional difficulty of switching off from work as well.
We can feel that it&#8217;s a requirement of our role to be available 24/7 and be responsive as a reflection of a caring and active community.
This is often not the case and that in fact is counter productive in building a sustainable community and providing quality interactions with our members.
Leaders don&#8217;t need to respond to all messages to be great.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each person&#8217;s work life balance is different with each their own prioritizes.
This is where self-care activities play a big part in establishing the distinction between work and personal life.
Make a clear differentiation of what you view as work, like answering community requests or emails, arrange calls or meetings etc and the hours that you aim to dedicate those to, anything outside of that communicate to yourself and to others that is your personal time.
By dedicating a consistent and explicit downtime, we begin to develop a habit that our body and mind anticipates and begins to look forward to thus easier to develop a good habit to maintain.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_addiction">6.6.1. Addiction</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work addiction, often referred to as workaholism, can affect anyone who is deeply embedded in an online community and often justifies their extensive work hours as commitment to the project.
The inability to stop is often driven by the compulsive need to achieve status and success, or in some cases to escape emotional stress.
Work addiction can be a vicious cycle where the feeling of achievement is an addictive "high" at the cost of our mental and physical well being, often not noticed until too late.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work addiction, like others addiction, there is a great difficulty with acknowledging there is a problem to begin with.
People suffering from work addiction are often in denial, convincing themselves that work is a pleasure.
However, eventually this over compensation of effort and time, neglect of personal relationships and well being, leads to the inevitable experience of burnout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important we develop a healthy relationship with our role itself without feeling the need to be on the pedal at full gas.
Try and assess what truly drives your motivations to achieve and does this require you to be online the amount of time you are.
Do you find that you feed off external praise as form of validation of your work?
Do feel that if you walked away from the community it would fall apart?
Identify those moments of pleasure, whether it&#8217;s ticking off a task, or receiving a compliment from a community member or boss, and evaluate whether or not they are needed in the same doses you are currently experiencing them at.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also find that this need to achieve is a reaction to a heavy workload from the lack of resources within the team trying to prove to others the value the role and team brings to the project or company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reconsider these goals with the aim to reduce your workload.
Are they achievable and maintainable with the current resources without sacrificing quality and a good work/life balance?
If they aren&#8217;t then consider prioritizing and communicating the most impactful goals that the team can achieve.
Delegate any other tasks to suitable members or establish more flexible timelines, and anticipate time for possible firefighting as part of those deadlines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only does this help to set reasonable expectations for the team members to achieve, but also promotes that a healthy work/life balance is an integral part of their schedule.
This predictable schedule also helps you to provide better forecasting to the company or community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_maintain_boundaries">6.6.2. Maintain boundaries</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When reflecting upon our work life balance, it is important to establish clear boundaries between the two.
As we&#8217;ve said earlier that due to our nature of work, we find ourselves participating within the community and this begins to eat into our personal time leaving nothing else.
This is tolerable only on a temporary basis and only when we are required for an intervention, but this should not be the norm.
Boundaries help us establish where our work ends, and pleasure begins.
We&#8217;re not saying that work isn&#8217;t pleasurable, but having a variety of activities other than work helps stimulate our minds and provide alternative creative outlets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These boundaries can also help the community acknowledge and accept your expectations of them as well of what they can expect from you.
Be as transparent as possible by defining your available hours, an escalation process and highlight the importance of documenting community processes so members feel more informed on what they should do in incidences with or without requiring assistance.
The aim is to establish a consistent schedule and the team and community to respect it. Although they may not do so on every occasion, you will be able to use your boundaries to help combat the feeling of guilt as you begin to embrace personal time as your own as well as respecting others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course if there are any serious incidences that requires your intervention during down time ensure you put into place mechanisms for the team to combat them rather than yourself being the only one who ‘can handle it'.
These mechanisms can be an escalation process or a team effort to respond and review the response collectively.
This helps encourages the mentality that everyone can lighten the load especially when it eats into yours and their personal time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintaining personal boundaries is also extremely important as well.
Our role often asks us to help members with their workload but also interpersonal communication on matters either between other team members.
But we need to be aware and recognize that we can&#8217;t solve every interpersonal issue or conflict – sometimes we just can&#8217;t become too involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As much as we don&#8217;t want to admit it, we must respect that we are not skilled or obligated to practice therapy if we feel it is required for a particular member.
When the conversations or observations become more apparent then aim to persuade them to seek medical or psychiatric help.
Our role is to aid members, but there is only so much we can achieve from our position and that is OK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be beneficial to par-take in mental health training for you and your team to learn how to handle situations involving members in the community or team.
This can help you apply a suitable process to follow upon if someone is beyond your ability and responsibility to help them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sustainability">6.6.3. Sustainability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sustainability is an extremely important goal to have for a community, often seen as a contributing factor to the project&#8217;s own success.
This should always be at the forefront of our minds when developing tools and processes for the community with the aim for it to become self-reliant, self-driven and empowered.
But there is a lot of work to be done to achieve this, and we need to ensure we and our team are able to keep up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Things become unsustainable when we have set unrealistic expectations either upon  ourselves or on the community.
When it comes to ourselves we can under estimate our project timelines because we have attributed our motivation as part of the estimation: the drive that will get us over the last hurdle.
Motivation is not on unlimited supply and can fluctuate drastically due to external and internal factors.
Try to extract motivation as a factor, although you may feel extremely excited about a project, don&#8217;t let that cloud your judgment on how long a project will take to complete.
If not, you may see it negatively affecting your work life balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We tend to also inaccurately assume the motivation of others in the community.
By definition community member are volunteers and yes we are fortunate to have those exceptional members that go above and beyond what is required.
However, we should not expect the same of all, in fact we should expect delays and anticipate them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By beginning to form clear boundaries, reduce your workload expectations, and improve estimations you start to deliver on realistic schedules.
Say you achieved a task within a week, rather than it taking triple that amount of time because you identified it as a priority; delegated other lower tasks to the team (or set the expectation it wouldn&#8217;t done at all); only worked within your allocated time; and were refreshed from recharging your mental well being with dedicated offline time.
This combination of activities and processes was key to achieving success thus triggering the event of providing and receiving continuous rewards and helping towards reducing the probability of members developing burnout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only thing that is ever consistent is time so be aware that you may find the same rewards you gave yourself and others, change over time.
Take time out to frequently reflect what drives you and your community, positively review how much you have progressed and assess what resources you have to adjust project goals accordingly without interfering, if possible, with a healthy work life balance.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_self_reflection">6.7. Self-Reflection</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_through_the_looking_glass">6.7.1. Through the looking glass</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important aspect of being a manager is to provide good and constructive feedback to those that are on our team, as well as the community as a whole.
We understand that feedback from upper line managers and those that report directly to us is extremely important to understand their perception of us as a person and our activities representing them: if they truly reflect our efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Retrospectives are now almost integral in software development teams to try to continuously improve an individuals or team performance, morale and identify problems that need solving.
However we find we don&#8217;t often do them for ourselves, with ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introspections are the examination of one&#8217;s own conscious thoughts and feelings.
This can refer to the mental state or in a spiritual sense, one&#8217;s soul.
Self-reflection, introspections and self-care are all intertwined with the aim to promote and sustain a positive direction for mental growth and development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introspection is extremely important for ourselves to evaluate our purpose and happiness we get from our actions, thoughts and behavior.
Work is an extremely big part of our lives so ensuring that our role, not only within the community, but the company itself, their values align with ours.
Else we will find ourselves becoming more and more dissatisfied by the role&#8217;s insufficient rewards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But first we need to know what our values are, what qualities we you enjoy of the role and the characteristics of the people we love to work with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take some time to truly answer these as gaining this self-awareness does not happen over night.
Use them to help you reflect on how you feel when you do the things you do, both positively and negatively.
Journaling is often a good, yet simple, practice you can do to clarify your thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Practicing self-reflection can be difficult to begin with due to previously discussed inner restrictions we place upon ourselves as community leaders: the need of being invincible; distorted perception of our worth; and lack of visible support.
However creating a routine of introspection and self-reflection as part of our self-care we will begin to exercise more control over our emotions: have inner clarity on our long term goals, and ability to identify more solutions-focused activities rather than the previously emotionally driven ones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tackling_imposter_syndrome">6.7.2. Tackling Imposter Syndrome</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This term was first defined by psychologists Dr Pauline Clance and Dr Suzanne Imes.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_25" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_25" title="View footnote.">25</a>]</sup> in the 1970&#8217;s as the internal experience one feels, despite overwhelming amount of evidence proving other wise, that they are incompetent and that their success was a product of luck or fraud within their field of expertise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often those that experience impostor syndrome have a hard time internalizing and accepting their success by minimizing positive feedback and comparing other&#8217;s work to their own.
This more frequently happens if we have started a new job, take on new responsibilities or role, or returned from a recent career break.
In order to compensate for this chronic self-doubt we begin to work late, procrastinate or try and justify our position in unnecessary ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dr Valerie Young.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_26" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_26" title="View footnote.">26</a>]</sup>, further categorized these types of flawed thinking of what sufferers believe it takes to be component into the following subgroups:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Perfectionist</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perfectionism and Imposter syndrome tend to go hand in hand.
When a perfectionist doesn&#8217;t achieve their unreasonable high standards they question their abilities and thus if they deserve to be in the position they are in.
If they do successfully achieve their goal, there always seems to be that unattainable objective they expected to have reached or knowledge they expected to have but didn&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Natural Genius</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These sufferers feel that the natural ability to achieve a task is a direct correlation to their competence.
If they take a long time to master something they feel that it has less merit.
Not only do they have high standards but they also have to complete it without breaking too much of a sweat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Soloist</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are those that shy away from asking for help because they fear that would expose them for who they believe others to see them as – a fraud.
Although being independent is good, it can lead to sub par results without acknowledging that two heads are often better than one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Expert</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People with this complex of impostor syndrome often dismiss their success because they don&#8217;t know everything there is to know about the topic or role.
Often these people dislike to be put on the spot in case there is some aspect they were unaware of and thus exposed as a fraud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Superhuman</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually these people often over compare themselves to others in their industry, the seemly high achievers, and push themselves to work harder and longer to measure up to them. They also tend to heavily rely on external validation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since our role as community managers is relatively new and less established than other roles within the tech industry we can find ourselves struggling to easily define and confirm our decisions due to the lack of expertise and documentation in this field.
We can find ourselves feeling more aware of being identified as a fraud especially when the company or project has never had a community manager before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are ways to help keep impostor syndrome in check and increase your self confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Celebrate Successes</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequently write down our successes and enjoy them.
Journaling is a good way to have comparisons from earlier successes and how they lead up to our current ones.
Include our own account of successes but better yet include testimonials from others, be it from community members responding to our thread posts, or colleagues praising our work.
This will help support that feeling that we are contributing value in our role and others confirmed that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Change your perspective</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We don&#8217;t attach to people or things, we attach to uninvestigated concepts that we believe to be true in the moment" - Byron Katie</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are hindered by our fear of being exposed as a fraud, but usually we don&#8217;t have the proof that confirms that is the case.
We often wrongly assume and interpret actions of others as a direct cause and affect to things we have done or said.
This is because we are viewing the situation from our perspective and only from ours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concentrate on what value your work brings to the subject or community and visualize that success.
Imagining good things happening can give you the confidence, and motivation, to commit to the task at hand and overcome the fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Working in progress</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are always learning, improving and progressing.
Treat our successes as continuously developing projects, adding refinements into each iteration.
Not only will we be able to record multiple successes but also help acknowledge that perfectionism is impossible and mistakes are opportunities for better learning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_network_of_support">6.7.3. Network of Support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We understand the power of a community, the ability to bring people together and with the right direction, and a whole lot of love, we can move mountains.
So why do we feel we can&#8217;t have the same mentality to helping ourselves?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During stress of tough times, whether its just a bad day, or more chronic episodes of illness, research has shown that having a strong, though not required to be large, social support network is beneficial to our well being.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_27" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_27" title="View footnote.">27</a>]</sup>
Without a social support network it can feel lonely and isolating which can lead into further depression and anxiety.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_28" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_28" title="View footnote.">28</a>]</sup>
Often it&#8217;s our social support network, even if we don&#8217;t think we have one, that first spots there is a change with our behavior before we do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A social support network is made up of friends, family and peers.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_29" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_29" title="View footnote.">29</a>]</sup>
Although this is different from a support group, which is more formal and often prescribed, a social support network is something we can develop as part of our community and team structure to help tackle stress, and promote self-care.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look towards those around you that you have a good relationship with and feel that you can confide in them.
When you are feeling stressful or want to simply vent your frustrations, come to lean on your social support network to do so in a safe and healthy way.
This unburdening of tension helps untangle your emotions, seek clarity on an aspect of decision making or just lightens your mood by the sheer enjoyment of speaking with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We may find that those within the community, which we spend most of our time with, grow to be included in our social support network and that each individual provides us with a unique form of support to help in different ways in our lives.
But also remember that we should also serve as a form of support to others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more education and communicating with our members about the benefits of self-care, the more likely we will see it being practiced and encouraged by others.
This in turns helps create a more caring and accepting atmosphere in the community.
Education can be in the form of discussions promoting self-care, celebrating mental health campaigns.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_30" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_30" title="View footnote.">30</a>]</sup>, adding to the community guidelines when on-boarding team members to speak to the team if their workload, or other aspects is affecting their health.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_31" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_31" title="View footnote.">31</a>]</sup><sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_32" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_32" title="View footnote.">32</a>]</sup>, or organizing training for team members on mental health awareness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you see a member on the team or community showing symptoms of burnout then reach out to them and let them know that you are concerned for their well being.
Identify that you are there to support them and more often they will respond positively and work together to elevate their stress.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_33" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_33" title="View footnote.">33</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to make clear here that if we feel that we are unable to assist a community member&#8217;s emotional stress beyond our role&#8217;s capacity, then encourage that they seek professional health advice immediately.
We may find ourselves feeling guilty we are unable to provide support, but we need to remind ourselves that we are not professional trained and thus could provide, though well intended, ill advice.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_34" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_34" title="View footnote.">34</a>]</sup>
Remember that other emotions affect those around them including how member&#8217;s stress can affect ours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly in our own direct reports' one-to-ones ensure you also have regular one-to-ones with your line manager to highlight any problems you have achieving your workload or affecting your well being.
Be as direct as you are with helping others, that you are with yourself.</p>
