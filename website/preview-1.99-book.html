<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Author: Karsten Wade &lt;<a href="mailto:quaid@iquaid.org">quaid@iquaid.org</a>&gt;
Updated: 2020-10-27</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An English idiom says, "There is a method to my madness.".<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
Most of the time, the things we do make absolutely no sense to outside observers.
They look like sheer madness.
But for those inside that messiness—inside that whirlwind of activity—there&#8217;s a certain regularity, a certain predictability, and a certain motive.
A method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source community management can seem like its own form of incomprehensible madness, especially to someone who&#8217;s unfamiliar with how open source software gets made, or those who find themselves staring down the prospect of having to coordinate others to join in making it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this guide hopes to provide is some insight into an ever-evolving methodology.
What are your preferences for practicing the open source way?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But beyond that, this work is really digging into the question of <em>why</em> someone might do the work this way.
Why use this or that method to organize the madness?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So from this introduction you should take two important points:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>There is a <em>what</em>, a <em>how</em>, and a <em>why</em> to the practice of successfully and sustainably creating and maintaining open source software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guide distills opinions from a sizeable group of open source practitioners, the kind of people always having to answer the question of <em>why we do this open source thing the way we do it</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, this guide is a living document that endeavors to gather and spread a diverse group of voices who are similarly (and somewhat-opinionatedly) collecting the best ways to create and manage an open source software community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These voices are all part of <a href="https://theopensourcway.org">this community of practice around open source software community management</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_shape_of_things_i_e_assumptions_we_are_making">1.1. The shape of things, i.e., assumptions we are making</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you look at the table of contents for this guide, notice how the flow of focus goes from the user, to the participant, to the contributor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This arrangement specifically tracks our view of how a community comes about and grows. And it all starts with a need.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A person or persons needing a solution creates the first iteration of the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other people with similar needs start using it, forming the core of the userbase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the userbase arise people who are enthusiasts of the software and things about/around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually arising from the users and the enthusiasts come people who are interested and have grown capable of contributing to the software in some way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the primary and continual focus for a project is to <em>take good care of your users</em>, for some of them will become your contributors, and you want them to do it out of love more than anger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key element of all this is recognizing the value in contributions of all types, at all levels.
Rather than valorizing only a single type of contribution, the best practice is to treat all manner of gifts to the project as equal.
These contributions comprise content and code, hours and effort, and all manner of broad contributions for the project via events, discussion forums, infrastructure maintenance, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you lower barriers to participation, you make your project welcoming at all levels.
This doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>remove all barriers</em>—just lower most of them appropriately.
Appropriate barriers are necessary for someone receiving keys to systems, for example, and these barriers are different from those allowing only certain participants to contribute a help article or a patch to the configuration management system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_our_core_opinion">1.1.1. Our core opinion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is an opinion at the core of this work, that explains how the content is laid out, how the steps on the path revealed so that you can find yourself wherever you are in your journey of open source practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focus on your end-users and lower the barriers to participation all around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors arise from participants, who all started as users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make your software wildly successful by having a user-centric initiative, while making the community open and welcoming those users come looking to see what is going on the creation/contribution side</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pathway of this guidebook therefore is:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Attract users</strong> to your software because it solves the problems they have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guide participants</strong> who care about open source and sharing good solutions so that they can be effective enthusiasts for your software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grow contributors</strong> from this rich, fertile user and enthusiast base, by making sure when any of those folks look into how the software is made, they see themselves represented and can imagine how they could fit in, too.
Make sure when they get to the contributor party, the barriers are clearly lowered and welcoming.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to let people know about your great dance party.
It&#8217;s another thing to empower those dancers to advocate for your way of throwing a dance party.
It&#8217;s a very great thing to make the dance party able to evolve to welcome all manner of music and dance from the world around us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the dancers who see your poster and show up in the first step to stick around, it helps if they can see right away that this is a place for them and theirs, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In considering this pathway, you can see there is no emphasis on expertise or even existing skills relevant to the project more than curiosity and willingness to try the software, to care about the software, and to help create the software.
This does not mean that people don&#8217;t bring skills to the project; they do, many of them right from first point of contact with the project.
But it is easier to teach skills than to teach someone to truly care about your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this journey, there are many best practices we recommend, including how to put together a plan for measuring your community&#8217;s progress.
We also list some specific areas to be careful of and watch out for, including a robust discussion on self-care and mental health considerations for community managers themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our best way of more-deeply conveying all this information is with stories.
Aside from stories that naturally arise in the body of the chapter, there are other areas in the guidebook and in <a href="https://theopensourceway">The Open Source Way community</a> to gather all these stories of why.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each section of this guide consists of one or more chapters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A chapter is a discrete discussion of a topic or a closely-related set of topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is that you can open and read a chapter as a stand-alone experience without needing to read the rest of the guide to understand and act from the material in that chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A chapter consists of several parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An introduction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary material, written in third person POV, focusing on a balance of what, how, why content. The examples (stories) told here are brief and in the third person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanded stories come at the end of the chapter, and are one or more stories from the chapter author(s). These may be written in the first person—that may be the most effective way to make the point in many cases. These stories are modular, in that another story that makes a similar point but from a different situation can be used instead.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea is to start with a base story or set of stories in a chapter, and supplement or substitute other stories that are contributed to the project, such as through the interview effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each chapter contains a lexicon at the end that defines the special usage for terms within that chapter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we&#8217;re collecting stories from practitioners of the open source way, stories we know tend to illustrate more than one principle in action.
Stories not interspersed into chapters will be collected at the end (for your endless uses).</p>

<h3 id="_a_community_of_practice_always_rebuilidng_itself">1.3. A community of practice always rebuilidng itself</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What you are reading here is just one facet of the growing body of principles, implementations, and examples that this community is gathering, cultivating, and maintaining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, it&#8217;s just one way to pull this material together (one method, you might say, of organizing the madness).
We&#8217;ll be updating this guide. We&#8217;ll be issuing similar, new guides. And we&#8217;ll experiment with other ways to understand and present this material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But at the core—in addition to the <em>what</em> and the <em>how</em> that benefit your open source community—you will also learn to understand the <em>why</em>, and be able to spread those stories wherever you go.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction">2.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do people participate in open source communities? What do they get out of it? Are they focused on their own needs, or are they mostly thinking about others?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that people are involved, the answer—as you might guess—is complicated and varied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One need only consider the behaviors we see in open source communities to very quickly intuit that there&#8217;s no single force at work here. After all, we see plenty of contributors on most big open source projects who are doing so at part of their day job. That doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t care about open source beyond a paycheck. But it does suggest different reasons for participation than the contributor working nights and weekends on their own passion project. Furthermore, we see contributors who are focused on solving some interesting technical problems while others are explicitly trying to bring about a societal benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t suss out some common patterns. Not only has there been academic research into open course contributions specifically, but there&#8217;s a whole body of psychology literature dealing with motivation. As a result, motivation is the lens we&#8217;ll use in this chapter to examine the question of why contributors participate in open source.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_extrinsic_motivation">2.2. Extrinsic motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could say that this type of motivator is about "Show me the money!" and leave it at that. Extrinsic motivation isn&#8217;t quite that simple, but payment in whatever form that took during a given era and place has historically been the go-to way to get people to do something. Whether to accumulate riches or provide themselves with basic necessities such as food and shelter. The idea that you do work you otherwise wouldn&#8217;t bother with in exchange for something of value is deep-rooted in most human societies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However obvious the existence of extrinsic motivation may seem to the average person, it wasn&#8217;t really a field of formal study until the 1940s when behaviorist Clark Hull, later working with Kenneth Spence, came up with the idea of drive reduction theory. This theory focused on reducing primary drives like hunger and thirst. If you&#8217;re hungry you eat. If you&#8217;re thirsty you drink. Drive reduction theory fell out of fashion, in part because it <em>didn&#8217;t</em> focus on things—like money—that could be used to reduce drives but only in a secondary way. However, we see echoes of drive reduction theory in familiar concepts like Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coming back to what makes contributors work on open source, money can, of course, be a big carrot. Even going back twenty years or so, many major open source projects had a significant number of contributors who were paid by their companies to work on open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Career advancement goes hand in hand with pay. But is open source software any different from proprietary software development in this regard? It may be. Multiple researchers have found empirical evidence to support the idea that there&#8217;s at least a perceived advantage to support the argument that there are career advantages to developing code that&#8217;s in the open and therefore available for others to look at and work with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More recently, there&#8217;s been significant empirical evidence to support the argument that there are career advantages to developing code and contributing content that&#8217;s in the open and therefore available for others to look at and work with. Indeed, the idea of "GitHub-as-resume" has become a common (if sometimes inappropriately applied) theme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_intrinsic_motivation">2.3. Intrinsic motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research beginning in the 1970s started to focus on intrinsic motivations, which do not require an apparent reward other than the activity itself. Self-Determination Theory, developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, would later evolve from studies comparing intrinsic and extrinsic motives, and from a growing understanding of the dominant role intrinsic motivations can play in behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With respect to open source software, it&#8217;s perhaps the ideological or altruistic motivations that first come to mind here. After all, in the case of free software at least, there was always an ideological and political element from the beginning even if there were also practical benefits for a user to have access to source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s some evidence from surveys that contributors can be somewhat motivated by these factors. However, the research results are mixed. Some contributors say on surveys that they&#8217;re participating, in part, for ideological or altruistic reasons. But the effect is most pronounced among contributors doing open source as a hobby. And while altruism certainly can influence professional contributors, this mostly seems to be the case among contributors who are <em>also</em> satisfied with their pay and other aspects of their career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variant of altruism is kinship amity. It&#8217;s related to the concept of gift economies but is specific to family (kin) groups which don&#8217;t expect a calculated <em>quid pro quo</em>. (In other words, family members do things for each other but they don&#8217;t typically keep a running tally, at least a systematic one, of who hasn&#8217;t been pulling their weight recently.) It&#8217;s different from altruism in that it is restricted to the group to which one belongs, such as an open source community. Here again the research is mixed. Studies have generally found a positive relationship between identified kinship amity and various measurements of effort, such as number of hours worked per week—but the correlation is often fairly weak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s just fun. This should come as no surprise to anyone who hangs around open source developers, designers, and content creators. Most of them <em>like</em> working on open source projects. One large study from 2007 (Luthiger and Jungwirth) determined that fun accounted for 28 percent of the effort (hours) dedicated to projects. Though, again, it&#8217;s easier to feel motivated by fun and altruism when it&#8217;s either a hobby or you&#8217;re otherwise satisfied professionally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_internalized_extrinsic_motivation">2.4. Internalized extrinsic motivation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s psychology literature also includes the idea of internalized extrinsic motivations. These are extrinsic motivations such as gaining skills to enhance career opportunities—but they&#8217;ve been internalized so that the motivation comes from within rather than coming as a direct result of a carrot being dangled by someone else. It&#8217;s the difference between learning a new language because you know keeping current on new tech pays off over time versus receiving a salary increase as a direct payoff for earning a certification. Gaining a good peer reputation, among community insiders and potential employers, for work in open source is one good example of how this type of motivation can play out in open source development. A variety of surveys have supported the idea that peer reputation is a driver for participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning is also frequently mentioned as a big benefit to participating in open source projects. Learning may be intrinsically satisfying but it can also be an important ingredient of career advancement. It can be hard to tease apart the intrinsic from the extrinsic here though.
Is it learning for learning&#8217;s sake? Is it learning for specific skills needed on the job?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A final motivator in this category is what researchers call "own-use value" but is more recognizably described as something like "scratch your own itch." Develop something that you want for yourself and create something for others in the process. That something is ultimately an external reward to yourself but no one is forcing you to do it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion">2.5. Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted earlier, motivations for many things are multi-faceted and contributing to open source software is no exception. However, here are three takeaways that you may find useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t expect non-extrinsic motivators to carry too much of the load.</strong> Many do contribute to open source projects for idealistic or altruistic reasons. But those are usually not the sole motivators and may not even be an important ones. Especially in the case of projects that have commercial backing, pay, and other professional working benefits matter a great deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Ampily non-extrinsic motivators such as learning and peer recognition.</strong> While not replacements for more direct benefits, the opportunity to be recognized by peers and to work in new technology areas are motivators. Organizations should consider peer recognition programs and explicitly encourage learning in order to make the best use of these motivational factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Motivators can be counter-productive when over-rotated.</strong> Precisely because motivations are multi-faceted, don&#8217;t place too big a bet on any single one. We already discussed the limitations of ideology and altruism. However, also consider something like "scratch your own itch" for example. If that&#8217;s the <em>only</em> someone contributes, they&#8217;ll tend to wander in and out of a project as their own specific needs merit. That may be a perfectly fine outcome, but it&#8217;s not a path to developing a long-term maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="_introduction_2">3.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the tools projects use to communicate continually evolve, best practices for communicating among project participants rarely change.
This chapter will cover the basics of project communications and offer advice on serving a global audience by making the best use of particular tools and platforms.
We&#8217;ll see how certain norms and techniques for maintaining productive communication in your community will ring true everywhere, regardless of the communication tools or platforms a project chooses.
And we will conclude with some observations on the ways ever-changing tooling and communication practices in open source projects may present challenges for the outside observer—particularly academic researchers—along with recommendations for mitigating those challenges in a way that benefits all project participants.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_evolution_of_communication_platforms_in_free_and_opensource_software_projects">3.2. The evolution of communication platforms in free and opensource software projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the number of free and open source software projects has increased over time, the communication tools projects use—both to connect with their users and to coordinate their developers and contributors—have evolved.
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was once the default choice for real-time project chat.
Many large projects conducted development discussions solely via their electronic mailing lists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecode">Freshmeat</a> was the place to hear about new project releases or updates to existing projects. Discussions about feature design and project improvements occurred via email and were included in a project&#8217;s mailing list archives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, the landscape has shifted in multiple ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While real-time chat is perhaps less common today, projects have not forgone it entirely.
Many projects have simply adopted services that are considered more user-friendly or accessible, for example, Gitter, Slack, RocketChat, and others.
A project may even use a tool to bridge back to older chat systems such as IRC in order to help a community evolve to include newer services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While some communities still employ email for asynchronous communications, others have found they can achieve better results by offering their users the opportunity to collaborate in online forums, a format more familiar to many developers who began coding at the same time they were sharing news and perspectives on then-new and popular forum sites like Reddit and Imgur.
Forum advocates find the visual layout more appealing, and forum administrators often prefer the medium&#8217;s fine grained access controls easier to use for moderation.
(For example, being able to stop all posts in a particular thread during a heated discussion is relatively easy via most forum software—not so with mailing lists.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Freshmeat remains active (now renamed to Freecode), free and open source software projects have also made extensive use of social media services like Twitter and Facebook to interact with their user and developer communities.
Social media serves as an excellent vehicle for project marketing and keeping audiences abreast of major project developments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Social media also provides a vehicle for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advertising upcoming events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live streaming of content or talks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating interest in a project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other forms of marketing and outreach that broadcast further than a project&#8217;s newsletter, website, or blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And many users now expect to receive basic technical support via these platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While mailing list archives may no longer serve as a definitive record of project discussions, <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s popularity as an online development and collaboration platform, has meant many projects now manage their development discussions via GitHub issues. GitHub&#8217;s issues can have <em>tags</em> to differentiate, for instance, between discussions addressing implementation of a new feature and those reporting that the software does not work as intended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet while the tools free and open source projects use to achieve communication are rapidly evolving, the human needs for both information and a sense of connection have not changed.</p>

<h3 id="_project_communications_the_basics">3.3. Project communications: The basics</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_great_communication_accomplishes">3.3.1. What great communication accomplishes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People must understand the "who," "what," "where," "when," "why," and "how" of working with an open source software community.
Thoughtfully established and well-maintained communication channels enable open source project and its participants to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish shared understanding of what the software it is, why people may wish to use it, and how they can get started doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate the community about how to use the software and how to contribute to the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep people informed about project events (like a conference or webinar) and developments (like a new software feature, the formation of a working group, or the arrival of new contributors).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserve knowledge about the project&#8217;s decision-making norms and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow users to report an error with the open source project&#8217;s software itself and to submit fixes for errors they or others uncover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a sense of common interest and purpose amongst participants, and provide an outlet for people in the project to socialize or "hang out" together online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a location for contributors to the project to collaboratively work together, be it on documentation for the project or to discuss how a particular part of the code base should be refactored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_know_your_audiences">3.3.2. Know your audience(s)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you develop project documentation and other informational resources, recognize this work has several different audiences.
Understanding these audiences and prioritizing their unique needs can help you craft better materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, consider the basic distinction between project <em>users</em> and project <em>developers</em>.
Someone interested in <em>using</em> the software will be interested in things like how to install it, how to configure it, and what they need to know to accomplish the task at hand (e.g., build a website).
Developers will also be interested in such details, but will need <em>additional</em> detail if they are going to contribute effectively to the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project observes certain coding conventions, be sure to include those conventions in the developer documentation.
Having a patch rejected by a maintainer because you haven&#8217;t indented code a certain way can be rather demotivating. Users, however, likely won&#8217;t need these details.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">

<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Develop a style guide for your project and make sure it is easy to find in your developer-oriented documentation.
Not every project will create its own style guide, but it is best practice to note what coding conventions the project will observe.
If the project uses a previously published style guide, make sure to link to it in the developer documentation.

<h3 id="_the_virtual_showcase_crafting_your_projects_website">3.4. The virtual showcase: Crafting your project&#8217;s website</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When people are looking for information about software that may help them solve a problem, their first stop will likely be the project website.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project website needn&#8217;t be intricately designed to be effective (though a more attractive site aids with project marketing).
A thorough README.md file on GitHub can work well as a project website, provided the information it offers gives users and potential contributors a sufficient overview of the project.
A basic project website should feature at least the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_project_overview">3.4.1. Project overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Include a simple overview of the project in an easy-to-spot location on the project website.
This project description should include what the code base is designed to do and what problems someone might solve by using it.
Making this information succinct and easy to find is critical.
Post a quick description on the project&#8217;s home page so that interested parties immediately discover if the project is designed to meet their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of this information as the opportunity to explain to someone who has never heard of your project why it could matter to them—in 30 seconds or less.
For example, Drupal&#8217;s <a href="https://www.drupal.org/about">about page</a> describes the project this way:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Drupal is content management software.
It&#8217;s used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day.
Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security.
But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles.
Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take another example from a popular project: Kubernetes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When visiting the project home page, <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes.io</a>, a visitor immediately sees the following explanation:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

<p>In this description, we immediately learn:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What Kubernetes is. (It&#8217;s a system for working with containerized applications, including deployment, scaling and management.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How Kubernetes is abbreviated. (Little details like this one immediately deepen the comfort level of new arrivals; no one is expected to already know an arcane acronym upon arrival.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where Kubernetes was developed. (Google is noted as the originator of this code base, establishing the project as focused on enterprise applications and providing confidence that the software is well designed and maintained.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kubernetes is open source. (A user can expect to use, run, modify, and share changes to the code base; any questions about barriers to entry due to licensing fees, procurement processes, etc., are dismissed.)</p>

<h4 id="_getting_started">3.4.2. Getting started</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processes for creating good "getting started" documentation—occasionally called "onboarding documentation"—are outside the scope of this chapter.
(Refer to the dedicated "Onboarding" section in this guidebook for more detail.)
Here, suffice it to say that open source project websites should feature a section aimed at helping new users and potential contributors get started using the software.
Clearly labeling that section "getting started" or "new users" makes finding that section easy when people need it.
Further differentiating between "new users" and "new contributors" in your onboarding documentation is even better, as these two audiences have very different needs.
Clearly pointing to these resources for newcomers on the project website helps to keep the project&#8217;s other communication channels—like the forums and real-time chat rooms—free from frequently repeated inquiries about how to get started.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock tip">

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_frequently_asked_questions">3.4.3. Frequently asked questions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another excellent location to feature basic information about your project is a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page.
If project development is just beginning, a basic FAQ detailing what the project is, what the code base is used for, and how someone can get access to the code is sufficient.
However, as more people join the project—new users, developers, documentarians, etc.—you will likely find yourself answering the same basic questions repeatedly.
(And in the process you&#8217;ll discover that many aspects of the projects are not as obvious to newcomers as they are to you.)
These repeat questions represent opportunities to improve your documentation and to seek help from your community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep your FAQ updated and easy to locate.
But even better: Ask community participants to help you improve it.
When answering a question for a newcomer, be it via email on the project mailing list or in real-time chat, ask the newcomer to write up the question and answer for inclusion in the project FAQ.
By asking for help from your community, you do several things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Get help keeping your documentation relevant and timely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate that community contributions to the project are welcome and encouraged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite further contribution from someone who has already shown interest in the project by asking for their help.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, newcomers would have the ability to edit the FAQ themselves.
Sending instructions for how to edit the FAQ along with your request to contribute to it—thus lowering the barrier to entry—makes receiving a contribution more likely.
If your project maintains a contributors list, make sure to include the people contributing to your FAQ in it.
People love seeing their work and contributions (however small) acknowledged.
Doing so gives contributors a sense of belonging and commitment to the project.
People who feel their work is appreciated and respected are more likely to stick around and contribute to the project, whether by filing issues or adding new features.</p>

<h4 id="_document_project_goals_and_non_goals">3.4.4. Document project goals and non-goals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your project&#8217;s website should also make clear the <em>purpose</em> of the project and the <em>activities</em> the project has as its focus.
People have difficulty understanding how they can best fit into a community and how they can contribute if they do not understand what activities are currently in progress and what is planned for the future.
One common tool to communicate these goals is a project roadmap.
Even if your project does not yet have sufficient resources to develop this kind of roadmap, you should still find some way to ensure users and would-be contributors understand the project landscape.
For instance, a weekly recap of project activities and planned activities for the coming week or month is an excellent start, and it&#8217;s something you can offer through a quick blog or forum post.
Such works are an excellent resource for newcomers orienting themselves to the project and are a wonderful place to point interested parties to learn more as part of their onboarding process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communicating your project&#8217;s <em>non-goals</em> is equally important.
Due to the vibrant nature of open source projects, it is only natural that someone will find a use for a project that the project&#8217;s creators never intended and will wish to extend the project&#8217;s capabilities to target that specific use case.
If the project maintainers do not intend for the project to have a wider focus than what is already offered, letting these would-be contributors know this in advance will save everyone time and disappointment.
In the era of "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)[easy forking]," it is relatively easy for those who would use some parts of the project but not others to develop and maintain a code base that better matches their own needs—all without asking the maintainers of the original project to deviate from their intended vision and the project scope they&#8217;ve set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documenting non-goals is also particularly important for commercially focused projects, where a contributor&#8217;s desire to create a feature as open source may be in conflict with vendor goals for creating proprietary features.
Contributors may still choose to create that feature as open source, but they should know from the start that upstream maintainers do not intend to include their work as part of the project&#8217;s code base.
Some may choose to not implement the feature, knowing that a vendor is creating it for them; still others may choose not to implement the feature if they know it will not be included in the project&#8217;s mainline source tree, as they do not wish to incur the burden of ongoing maintenance themselves.
And others may choose to go ahead and create something that works well for them and release it as open source, regardless of whether the feature is incorporated into the project&#8217;s main source repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most important here is that no one feels <em>surprised</em> by the direction a project will take.
No project needs to accept every contribution, but having contributors invest time and energy into developing something only to discover it will not be accepted due to a conflict with an unknown roadmap (commercial or otherwise) creates tension in the community and a lack of trust in the project maintainers.
It can even encourage adoption of open source alternatives to the vendor&#8217;s product.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_an_issue_tracker">3.5.1. What is an issue tracker?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An issue tracker (sometimes also known as a "bug tracker, "issues list," or "issue queue") is a tool that allows people to submit reports when they encounter instances where they believe the software is not working as intended.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>
As a way to monitor pending tasks and allow for collaborative commenting and review of work in progress, some projects manage their entire development workflow via their issue trackers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll discuss using an issue tracker for the purpose of reporting failures with the software.
By reporting your issue using a project&#8217;s issue tracker, you ensure maintainers who are looking out for problems see your report and act upon it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_why_file_an_issue">3.5.2. Why file an issue?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While filing an issue may seem more cumbersome than simply asking for help in real-time chat, it is important to do for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project contributors cannot keep track of all conversations occurring across various platforms, but they can always refer to the issue tracker to improve the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Real-time chat and social media are ephemeral communication channels.
The issue tracker is a purpose built tool for recording and reviewing problems with the software.
Software projects often define their upcoming work plans by using their issue tracker as a key component—and perhaps their sole tool—to prioritize all possible areas to work on.
(Simply put, the project&#8217;s issue tracker is very often synonymous with the project&#8217;s to-do list.)
If your problem does not make its way into the issue tracker, it will likely not be addressed simply because a very busy person has forgotten the details of the problem.
For this reason, you will often find that one of the first requests you receive when asking for help is to file an issue so the project maintainers can keep track of the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Filing an issue allows you and the project contributors to communicate asynchronously about the problem, as all parties can refer back to and access the issue description and follow up comments at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;ve uncovered a problem with the software, you might discover that the problem is actually the root cause of <em>another</em> problem, or there may be a way in which <em>several</em> problems are related.
Issue tracking software allows project developers to group related issues together, which may aid in diagnosing a problem&#8217;s root cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People often encounter the same issues with software, and many of them are filing issues with the project.
Having multiple reports of the same problem can be very time consuming for the project maintainers, as they then need to respond to each individual reporter about work in progress.
Fortunately, issue trackers make this process easier for maintainers by allowing them to quickly close issues by stating they are duplicates of an existing one (and then asking the bug reporter to track work-in-progress in the "original" report).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project maintainers can then engage in broadcast-style communication to everyone experiencing the problem in one place, streamling their workflow while still helping everyone who needs assistance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_make_the_issue_tracker_findable">3.5.3. Make the issue tracker findable</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure the location of your project&#8217;s issue tracker is prominently displayed in your FAQ, as well as in your usage and development documentation.
If people cannot figure out where to submit an issue, they will ask someone in the project where to do so. Supporting well-meaning users by offering repeated answers to basic questions like this one can be quite time consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do yourself and your community a favor and make your issue tracker very easy to find!.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_use_issue_templates">3.5.4. Use issue templates</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not everyone who uses your software will be familiar with your community&#8217;s conventions for filing a useful bug report.
To save you and the bug reporter time, offer an issue template to ensure you receive the information you need to reproduce the reported error and effectively triage it.
For example, you may need to know what version of the software or what operating system was in use when an error occurred.
If common information is required for reproducing errors, ask for it in an issue template.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Common fields in issue templates include a summary of the issue, steps to reproduce it, the actual behavior the user observes, the intended behavior for the software, and a request for log files or screenshots to help guide the issue reviewer in better understanding the bug report.
Several issue trackers support templates for bug reports, including <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_issue_templates">Redmine</a>, and <a href="https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracTicketTemplatePlugin">Trac</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find yourself asking for the same information over and over again in response to different bug reports, then congratulations. You have uncovered an area of your template in need of improvement.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_help_wanted_labeling_issues_for_clarity_and_encouraging_contribution">3.5.5. Help wanted: Labeling issues for clarity and encouraging contribution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most modern issue trackers allow users to label issues they file, which can be useful for organizing project work.
By differentiating between different types of requests—features for development, software errors, etc.—a project&#8217;s maintainers can be more organized and triage issues more efficiently.
Further, many people interested in contributing to open source software projects are looking for issues on which they can work to better understand the project&#8217;s development mechanics.
If you will actively use labels in your issue tracker, make sure to document the label definitions in your development documentation so those labels are used consistently (or restrict the addition of issue labels to project maintainers only).
A list of labels that used inconsistently is no more helpful than a list of undifferentiated issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Labeling issues as "for newcomers" or "help wanted" allows project maintainers to flag issues particularly suited to contributors who have just joined the project.
Labeling issues in this way shows that the project is prepared to onboard new contributors and that maintainers welcome community assistance in a particular area.
Don&#8217;t be afraid to file issues against project documentation, the website,or anything else you feel is amiss.
If there&#8217;s a place current and potential contributors can help make the project better, file these in your issue tracker with a clear label that shows them they can contribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just make <em>very clear</em> (either in the text of the "help wanted" issue or via a link to other project documentation) how you wish others to engage with the project when working on these types of issues.
(The <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html">Apache Subversion Issues page</a> is an excellent example of clearly articulating needs to the user community before they file an issue.) It is best to encourage contributors working on these issues to engage with the project maintainers along the way, so their contributions have a higher chance of acceptance into the project.
Nothing squelches a contributor&#8217;s enthusiasm like showing up with a working solution to the stated problem only to be told their particular implementation will not meet the project&#8217;s needs.</p>

<h4 id="_communicate_clearly_and_kindly">3.5.6. Communicate clearly and kindly</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you are a user of the project reporting an issue or a project maintainer reviewing a pull request, it is always important to communicate about the issue <em>clearly</em> and <em>kindly</em>.
When a tool is not working, the person using it can become frustrated.
Likewise, a person developing a project as a hobby is unlikely to respond well to demands on their time to fix a problem they do not have.
Remember to be gracious and thankful in your discussions with other project participants, as everyone sharing their knowledge is contributing to the project&#8217;s overall health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>If an issue has become especially contentious and discourse has become rude or inflammatory, restrict access to that issue for a stated period of time (say 24 to 48 hours) to allow people time to calm down, reflect, and state their argument in a more even-tempered and constructive manner.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Include as much information as you possibly can about the error you have encountered.
If the project uses issue templates, fill one out as completely as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not have the information requested or cannot determine how to get it yourself, simply note what you have attempted to do in order to get the information.
These details help maintainers determine what they might need to do to assist you.</p>

<p>If a project does not use issue templates, look at other issues that have been "closed‒fixed" or at merged pull requests to see how other people have filed bug reports.
If the issue was fixed, chances are quite good that you&#8217;ll be able to use these historical artifacts as examples of the sort of information necessary for reproducing an error.
Replicate what you find in these reports and add more detail as you are able.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"While the size and skill of the development community constrains the rate at which tickets can be resolved, the project should at least try to acknowledge each ticket the moment it appears.
Even if the ticket lingers for a while, a response encourages the reporter to stay involved, because she feels that a human has registered what she has done (remember that filing a ticket usually involves more effort than, say, posting an email)."—Karl Fogel, Producing Open Source Software.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thank the submitter for filing the issue.
Helping a project improve is an excellent contribution to that project&#8217;s health.
Further, by being gracious, kind and welcoming, you encourage continued participation and contribution from the issue reporter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When closing an issue as "won&#8217;t fix," explain why the issue will not be fixed.
Maintainers shouldn&#8217;t feel compelled to accept every pull request or fix every reported issue, but they should at least let bug reporters know <em>why</em> they won&#8217;t be addressing certain issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, if someone has submitted an issue along with code to fix a problem or implement a new feature, it is vital to tell them why their work has not been accepted by the project.
Not doing so makes the contributor feel like they&#8217;ve wasted their time and should devote their energies to a different software project.
In an ideal world, you are able to include a link to a published project roadmap that explains why the submission does not meet the needs of the project.
(Refer to above.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For new contributor submissions, fix minor issues with the patch yourself along with a note about what you fixed and why.
Having a patch rejected for minor nits discourages additional contribution, and often it takes just as long to explain why a patch is being rejected as it does to make very small fixes.
Such explanations are an excellent time to point contributors to additional project resources, such as your coding style guide, documentation on communication norms, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For submissions coming in response to a "help wanted" issue, engage early and often with the person who has stated an interest in working on the issue.
Doing so ensures that the contributor&#8217;s submission will actually meet the project&#8217;s needs.
Further, by being available to and in regular dialogue with new contributors, you form a relationship with them that encourages mutual learning and increases the chances they will continue to contribute to the project&#8217;s ongoing work.</p>

<h4 id="_having_development_discussions_and_other_conversations_in_the_issue_tracker">3.5.10. Having development discussions and other conversations in the issue tracker</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conventional wisdom in the early days of open source software development held that communities should <em>not</em> carry on development related discussions in the project&#8217;s issue tracker.
Project communities instead preferred carrying on such conversations via mailing lists or in forums a number of reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>People following the mailing list were able to comment and express their views and needs without needing to parse through the issue tracker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forum or mailing list conversations were seen as better for asynchronous and long-form communications, and popular issue trackers in the 1990s and early 2000s were an unwieldy way to engage in actual discourse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovering why a particular technical decision was made when those details were buried in an issue tracker was difficult, especially since the issue would be in a "closed" state once the decision was made.
Looking for a closed issue to explain the technical direction of the project was considered counterintuitive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the rise in popularity of GitHub as a one-stop platform for online development work, conversations in the project issue tracker have become mainstream.
GitHub&#8217;s issue system visually mirrors the typically expected visual interface for forum software, making discussions in its system seem natural for those who began their development careers when online forums were first gaining popularity.
Further, time and resources necessary for maintaining a Mailman instance or additional forum software as part of project infrastructure became cumbersome when all other infrastructure could be managed via a single tool.
The addition of features such as the ability to "+1" an issue, set fine-grained controls on notifications for specific issues, and lock specific issues so that only project maintainers may edit it (while still allowing others to view the issue) made the move to discussions in the issue tracker more palatable and effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nonetheless, interested parties should be able to follow discussions <em>outside</em> the project&#8217;s issue tracker.
Only the most deeply interested and invested individuals will rigorously follow every issue update, making engaging with the project difficult for casual contributors.
While excellent search capabilities in online issue trackers make finding closed issues easier, the flow of an issue discussion does not fulfill the same function as a narrative description of a particular implementation or an explanation of why a certain decision was made.
Note, too, that some maintainers who are most intimately familiar with the project—those who can recall specific issue numbers for particular discussions with ease—will not always be available to help with the project work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Preserving the knowledge about decisions in an easy-to-access way:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</li>
<li>

Be sure your documentation clearly outlines your project&#8217;s various communication channels.</p>

Your documentation must make clear <em>what</em> each channel is used for, <em>when</em> to use a particular communication mechanism, and <em>how</em> people can expect to receive communications from the project and its community members through that channel.
For example, a project with few maintainers who develop the work as a hobby project may wish to note on the project website that those developing the project do so in their spare time, so immediate responses to mailing list inquiries should not be expected.
Someone whose hobby project is in use with enterprises might like to make explicit the notion that help is provided on a best effort basis.

Project maintainers and community members do well to lead by example.

The statement tells users and would-be contributors that they may not always get what they want from the project maintainers, but that errors will be fixed and reasonable requests will be listened to, if not acted upon.
Most notably, it&#8217;s a list of expected <em>prosocial behaviors</em> rather than simply a list of what <em>not to do</em>.
It identifies behavior the project maintainers and community members model and transforms it from the actions they take into words that help everyone understand what actions constitute good project citizenship.</p>

<h4 id="_developing_a_project_social_contract">3.7.2. Developing a project social contract</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As projects document their community communication norms, they may find developing a project social contract to be a particularly effective exercise.
A project social contract documents behaviors the project expects all participants to display and sets expectations for how project members will be accountable to others.
The social contract is not necessarily a list of forbidden behaviors, but rather a statement about how members of the project will choose to self-govern for everyone&#8217;s success.
By undertaking the process of creating a social contract through dialogue, members establish empathy with one another and set the foundation for future conversations.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_codes_of_conduct">3.7.3. Codes of conduct</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects use a code of conduct as a means to document their expectations around civil discourse.
Open source projects that seek any outside contribution should always have a code of conduct.
For projects that host events, whether virtual or in person, developing code of conduct specific language around events is also a best practice.
Think of the code of conduct as an aspect of the project&#8217;s social contract, one that includes the rules by which the community will govern itself and how each member will hold one another accountable for those moments when they could have behaved differently and achieved a better outcome.
These rules must be understood and made explicit.
Otherwise people will know neither what is expected of them nor whether the project is a place where they will feel welcome and comfortable contributing their time and expertise.
See this guidebook&#8217;s chapter on governance for more information about codes of conduct.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve focused primarily on ways in which software project <em>maintainers</em> can ensure the best possible outcomes for communication in their projects.
However, contributors, too, can take a number of steps to ensure they&#8217;re communicating effectively with their favorite open source communities.
Here are just a few:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Read the project website and documentation before jumping into discussions.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">

</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do your research, and tell people you&#8217;ve done it.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If you run into a problem using open source software, do what you can to solve the problem yourself. There&#8217;s no shame in not being able to solve the problem, and it helps your bug report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to include what steps you have taken to resolve the issue when filing a bug report or asking for help in one of the project&#8217;s communication channels.
Doing so saves people time and energy, as they will not ask you to try something you have already done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listing the ways you&#8217;ve already attempted to help yourself is a demonstration of respect for the time and energy of the project&#8217;s maintainers.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology">basic netiquette</a>.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Most fundamental advice for communicating on the internet is applicable in open source projects and communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, avoid typing in all capital letters, as this style is read as shouting (and one would not go about asking for help by shouting at someone).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a username or screen name that is reasonable and approachable, otherwise you risk not being taken seriously by others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait a reasonable amount of time—say 24 to 48 hours—for a response to your inquiry before trying to get a response in a different communication channel.</p>

<p>Encountering information in a place people don&#8217;t expect can overwhelm them.

<p>If the project has taken the time to let contributors know how and where to ask questions—and you should know this by following the guidance in the first item on this list—make sure to use the appropriate forum to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrating you have taken the time and energy to interact with the project&#8217;s maintainers and other volunteers in the way they&#8217;ve asked shows you respect their efforts and, in turn, makes helping you be successful much easier for them.</p>

<h3 id="_evolving_communications_in_open_source_projects_and_academia">3.9. Evolving communications in open source projects and academia</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While open source software now seems ubiquitous, we should recall that the free and open source software movements are still in their early stages.
Development of the Linux operating system began in 1991.
The Apache Software Foundation, steward of many of the world&#8217;s most notable open source projects, was incorporated in 1999.
Though 20 or 30 years seems like ancient history on the internet, it is worth noting that Ada Lovelace created the world&#8217;s first algorithm back in the 1840s.
Open source is still a blip (albeit a significant one) in a much longer technological timeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to open source&#8217;s disruptive influence in the software industry, academic researchers have found open source software projects and their development methodologies particularly worthy of study.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, as projects' communication tools and platforms have evolved, researchers' ability to access project data for the purpose of study has been, at times, diminished.
For example, parsing IRC logs of a project&#8217;s real-time chat often yielded fruitful information about a particular project, but as some projects have moved to other chat systems, such logs are no longer commonly available (nor has there been any guaranteed longevity of the project&#8217;s chat archives, depending on which communication tool the project chooses).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a project launches or consists of a small group of people working together, choices for how to communicate and where to do so often arise organically and with little consideration to the future impact of those choices.
But project maintainers should thoughtfully consider how they can ensure the project&#8217;s communications—which contain potentially rich sources of data and historical artifacts like lore and decisions histories—are effectively captured for both the project participants and interested observers.
To understand how researchers benchmark community activity and analyse the outputs of various parts of your project, consider reviewing the work of the <a href="https://chaoss.community/"><em>Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software</em></a> (CHAOSS) Project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion_2">3.10. Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most effective way to achieve communication in open source projects is to show others kindness and courtesy, and to assume good intent upon first contact with people you&#8217;ve never met.
Though this chapter contains any number of helpful best practices for effective communication, simply acting with graciousness to other people is the most important step one can take to communicate well.
Remember there is a human being reading what you have written, and remember to treat them with the same respect you want for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="_introduction_3">4.1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll discuss assessing and evolving an open source project or community governance model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All organizations operate in and with governance structures.
The term "governance" carries multiple meanings in an organizational context.
It can refer to regulatory matters or risk management issues, for example.
More generally, though, it can also refer to a system of rules, roles, and procedures that determine how power in an organization gets distributed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because open source projects are organizations, every one features governance structures.
Some of these structures are more <em>explicit</em> than others.
Some are more <em>formal</em> than others.
But every project has them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, too many discussions of open source project governance focus on activities or resources, like "speaking for the project" or "ownership of the web domain."
While documenting these functions is useful, we should remember that these are <em>aspects</em> of a project&#8217;s governance, but they are not the full extent of it.
At its heart, open source project and community governance is about <em>people</em>—their rights and responsibilities as part of a project and the expectations others have for them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_governance">4.2. What is governance?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply put, "governance" refers <strong>to the rules or customs that determine who gets to do what (or is supposed to do what), how they&#8217;re supposed to do it, and when.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two categories of governance-related issues are most pertinent to open source projects: those related to <strong>roles</strong> and those related to <strong>policies and procedures</strong>.
For the purpose of explanation, we&#8217;ll discuss each of these issues separately.
In practice, however, they&#8217;re inseparable—two sides of the same coin, as our forthcoming example will demonstrate.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_roles">4.2.1. Roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A great deal of activity hinges on roles-related governance in open source projects.
Think of a <strong>role</strong> as a function someone in the project performs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When analyzing your own project&#8217;s roles-related governance systems, ask the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What roles do (or can) project contributors play?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualifies a person to play a particular role in the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What duties, privileges, and forms of authority are associated with each role?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What project resources are the province or responsibility of people who perform certain roles?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_policies_and_procedures">4.2.2. Policies and procedures</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While contributors occupy certain roles in an open source project, the project&#8217;s governance structure also determines how those people do what they do as part of the project.
<strong>Policies and procedures</strong> refer to the processes and guidelines contributors follow when performing their roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When analyzing your project&#8217;s procedure- or policy-related governance systems, ask the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do various contributions get accepted into the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do contributors come to occupy and eventually depart from certain roles in the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can role descriptions and responsibilities be changed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do project decisions get made (and by whom)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are debates and conflicts resolved (and by whom)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_roles_policies_procedures_an_example">4.2.3. Roles, policies, procedures: An example</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember: A project&#8217;s <strong>roles</strong> and its <strong>policies and procedures</strong> aren&#8217;t discrete; they&#8217;re interwoven as part of the project&#8217;s overall governance model.
For example, consider a project role called "Documentation Maintainer." A project might outline that role this way:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Role Title: Documentation Maintainer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualifications: several years of consistent contributions to documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Role: other Documentation Maintainers can nominate and vote to grant this role to eligible contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duties: write documentation and review documentation from other contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privileges: speak for the documentation team, participate in development meetings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authority: ultimate decision on documentation content, technology, and strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Procedure: other Documentation Maintainers vote on changes to role description</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many cases, a project&#8217;s actual role descriptions are more elaborate than that (some projects' role handbooks are dozens of pages long).
As projects mature, the number of different roles people play in them can increase.
Moreover, larger and more mature projects associate roles with <em>collectives</em>—that is, a group of contributors can perform a certain role jointly.
For instance, a project might feature several "steering committees," each with its own set of election procedures.
This is true for the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes project</a>, where "special interest groups" are a popular unit of governance.
In that project, the role of Code Contributor is subdivided further by interest group (team) and by contributor level (Member, Reviewer, Approver, and Owner).
So a contributor&#8217;s <em>actual</em> role would be something like "SIG‒Network Approver," not just "Code Contributor."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_governance">4.3. Why governance?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some open source communities, the idea of "governance" has a poor reputation.
This is true in cases where project contributors tend to construe governance as a purely negative force—a set of rules or procedures aimed solely at telling people what they can&#8217;t do, how they shouldn&#8217;t act, or how they should limit themselves to acting only within certain boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But a well-crafted governance model can in fact be a largely positive force in open source communities.
A project&#8217;s governance model outlines that project&#8217;s <em>terms of engagement</em>—the specific, tried-and-tested structures for working together and making decisions that project contributors have found works best for the community.
A clear governance model encourages new contributors to become involved in your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A well-designed system of governance is much less likely to turn away or de-motivate project participants than a vague or non-existent one is.
Consider your project from the perspective of new contributors.
Are new contributors <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> likely to jump into a project without any sense of the role they&#8217;re supposed to play and the rules they&#8217;re supposed to follow when they want others to seriously consider your contributions?
A clear governance model helps people understand precisely how they can make an immediate contribution to a project, how they can pitch in without upsetting the project&#8217;s rhythms, how they can escalate questions or issues if they have them, and what sorts of leadership positions they can aspire to if they stick around long enough.
So a community&#8217;s goal in architecting a governance model should be, "Make structures of participation obvious."
When your project&#8217;s rules are clear, contributors can engage with confidence.
Taking this approach to governance can positively impact a project&#8217;s long-term viability and growth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_making_governance_explicit">4.4. Making governance explicit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that every open source project features different roles contributors can play and procedures that people in those roles are typically (or should be) following.
This is true whether or not those roles and procedures are actually documented anywhere.
Where roles aren&#8217;t documented, they are implicit in regular contributors' activities (and not infrequently a source of argument).
Successful open source projects make their governance models explicit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a 2018 study, <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/4/new-governance-model-research">researcher Javier Canovas found</a> that 19 of the 25 most-starred projects on GitHub hadn&#8217;t published documents outlining their governance models.
Canovas considered this unfortunate for several reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"First, [explicit governance] helps promote an organization&#8217;s sense of transparency," he writes.
"One could know how much time a group takes to consider an issue, the chances contributions have of making an impact on the organization, or who is going to hear their voices when they speak up.
Second, explicitly defining a governance model may also help one better understand and classify how open organizations are driven."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how this works: in 2018, the Kubernetes project added a set of detailed, comprehensive Role Handbooks for their Release Team.
These handbooks outlined information related to the Release Team role, including qualifications necessary for joining the team, duties members of the team perform, and details on the team&#8217;s decision-making processes.
As a result, the Release Team became the most popular point of entry for project contributions; new participants knew exactly what to expect.
Other teams within Kubernetes followed suit—and experienced a doubling or even tripling of the number of new contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clear and explicit governance models have another critical benefit—cultivating a strong sense of trust in your project&#8217;s community.
Members of projects with robust, detailed governance models benefit from a shared commitment to a transparent set of procedures, policies, and role descriptions.
They can appeal to a commonly understood set of guidelines when disputes arise.
All of this makes questions about participants' motives, intentions, goals, and authority less contentious.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_community_originated_projects_evolve">4.5. How community-originated projects evolve</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source projects rarely begin by "selecting" and implementing a perfectly preconceived governance model.
Much more commonly, projects' governance models evolve as their communities grow and diversify.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In its early days, a project might only have one or two developers, making discussions of "governance" largely irrelevant (the project is simply not big enough to have a need for any structured decision-making process).
But this will change as the project attracts additional contributors.
And because a project&#8217;s governance model, its culture, and the behaviors of its leaders are all intimately entwined, any change to one will likely spur changes in the others.
While every project is different—growing in its own way and following its own trajectory of maturation—we might note certain common, recurring milestones in a project&#8217;s development that tend to trigger governance evolutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_work_among_founders_1_or_2_members">4.5.1. Work among founders (1 or 2 members)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects that start with a single developer (or small group of developers) do not often require any formal governance structure.
Gauging consensus is easy, and during the early stages of a project, disagreements about what should be done (and who should do it) are rare.
A project&#8217;s early members all typically have carte blanche to take the actions they see as best for the project, like approving code for inclusion.
Normally, no structure is required in addition to a GitHub repository, and all early developers receive project membership status almost immediately.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_early_project_growth_up_to_5_members">4.5.2. Early project growth (up to 5 members)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As projects begin growing, the limitations of this approach become obvious.
When a project has even five developers, coordinating work becomes more difficult, and newer developers may not be immediately familiar with the design choices and coding standards the project&#8217;s early developers have followed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the first evolution projects tend to undergo is often one that requires code submissions to undergo peer review before being merged.
The "first level" of the project&#8217;s hierarchy consists of those with the authority to approve pull requests or code and content submissions for inclusion in the project.
Initially, deciding who receives this authority is easy; the project&#8217;s original, trusted developers all receive it, and the project founder acts as final arbiter in case of disagreements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mid_term_project_growth_10_to_15_members">4.5.3. Mid-term project growth (10 to 15 members)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next event to trigger a project governance evolution is often related to how people who join the project become recognized members of the group.
This tends to occur when the size of the project has increased to approximately 10 or 15 developers.
At this point, a project community typically must develop more formal guidelines for admitting new project members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One common standard projects use to assess new members is sustained participation (how long and how often the contributor has been active in the project) combined with a judgment about what one might call "good taste"—an assessment about the quality of work a contributor tends to submit, that contributor&#8217;s good judgement in review comments, etc.
Still, the project founder tends to be the gatekeeper and final arbiter of who gets promoted inside the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_corporate_originated_projects_evolve">4.6. How corporate-originated projects evolve</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some open source projects that begin life as the work of a professional software development team operating in a corporate environment tend to evolve somewhat differently.
Because these projects originate in corporate environments, they often inherit the organizational structure of those environments.
They may, for example, already feature a robust group of developers with their own notions of hierarchy (managers, architects, junior and senior developers, and so on).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_early_stage_corporate_originated_projects">4.6.1. Early-stage corporate-originated projects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initial efforts to increase community engagement in the projects tends to focus on growing adoption and engaging with early users.
Pre-existing developer teams typically continue project planning, however, in a centralized manner.
For this reason, external contributors may find engaging with the project more difficult—and the project may not gain sufficient traction as a result.
The rapid pace of project changes, the opacity of the planning process, and the strength of pre-existing relationships between the project&#8217;s developers can make feature development more difficult for external contributors.
Early patch submissions may stay unreviewed for longer periods of time, and these submissions will be relatively infrequent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is as far as many corporate-originated projects will evolve.
While the core team may engage actively with the project&#8217;s user base, resources required to <em>grow</em> that developer base are considerable, and many organizations choose not to make the investment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, one oft-cited benefit of the open source model is an ability to collaborate with industry partners and competitors and share the burden of development of common requirements.
If this is a goal, then growing participation in a corporate-originated project beyond a single vendor is critical.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_evolving_to_multi_vendor_corporate_open_source">4.6.2. Evolving to multi-vendor corporate open source</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For corporate-originated projects, expanding project participation involves engaging with both interested individuals who are using the project and vendors who might be motivated to invest in the project.
Uniting these parties will have implications for project governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many projects begin enticing other vendors to contribute by demonstrating a viable market for the project.
Vendors typically do not invest sustainably in open source projects unless they can justify that investment.
Illustrating significant and enthusiastic user adoption of the software is therefore critical at this stage.
Initial efforts focus on accelerating adoption momentum and successfully converting users into contributors by soliciting their active participation in the project roadmap and project promotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, a project may attempt to engage with other vendors by focusing on encouraging collaborators to "build on" a common platform.
While companies may not be able to justify significant investment in the project "core," they may be able to justify investment in <em>extensions</em> to a project—if those extensions are relatively inexpensive and can support their business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, by focusing initial outreach and engagement efforts on the APIs, the developer experience for extensions, and the path to distribution for people writing those extensions, projects may grow large communities of vendors building atop a platform, rather than modifying the core platform itself.
Distinguishing these two areas of development—between the "core" and the "periphery"—often involves making governance decisions specific to each (only some project roles may receive permission to operate in the project "core," for instance).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a corporate-originated project has demonstrated substantial market opportunity (either by proving that the project fills a significant gap in the market or by growing a large user base directly), it can engage with potential vendor partners to collaborate on the project.
This discussion is partly technical and partly business-focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before making a significant investment of engineering resources in a project, vendors will likely ask:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can we engage with the project on a level playing field? Or do stakeholders use different processes to evaluate changes from different vendors (Contributor Licensing Agreements that give additional rights to the originating vendor over others, for example)? One common way to ensure a level playing field from a legal perspective is to contribute the project&#8217;s management and trademark to a foundation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this project meet a customer need? Vendors will consider market fit, and how the project fits into their product portfolio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accepting participation from additional vendors can significantly impact a project&#8217;s governance.
One way to ease potentially turbulent impacts is to target vendors with whom the originating vendor does not compete directly.
For example, a cloud hosting company may have more success recruiting a vendor of on-premise software products to its project than it would recruiting a competing hosting vendor.
Competing vendors may only be willing to join when a project can demonstrate a consistent record of multi-vendor engagement in the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_governing_sustained_evolution">4.7. Governing sustained evolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once project participation reaches a kind of "critical mass," many common patterns emerge—regardless of whether an individual or corporation has initiated a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all the cases we&#8217;ve discussed so far, rules and procedures for decision making tend to be implicit.
And since most open source projects never recruit more than 10 active developers (or one core vendor), most projects never reach a point where explicitly documenting project governance becomes necessary.
Those that do, however, will likely adopt even more nuanced and complex governance models.
Refer to "Examples of open source governance models" below to learn more about these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, when projects reach this size, they seek to transition management and trademark of a project to an independent entity (usually called "foundations" in the open source world).
On rare occasions, projects may establish their own independent consortium for this purpose.
More frequently, however, a project will approach an existing foundation (such as the Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the OpenStack Foundation, or the Software Freedom Conservancy, to name just a few) and ask the foundation to adopt the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When selecting a foundation with whom to partner in this way, open source projects must make several considerations, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>cost structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance requirements imposed by the foundation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>affinity of the foundation with the user and developer base of the project</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, projects will commonly discuss the extent to which member fees should influence the project&#8217;s technical governance. Two dominant models for this governance exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is a strict separation of funding and technical inputs, where the members who join at the highest membership level have input into (and can influence) project budgetary matters (for example, how funds will be disbursed between infrastructure, headcount, marketing, events), but technical merit dictates how the project is governed technically.
The second is a "pure member" organization, where members are entitled to appoint representatives to a technical governing board with oversight on which sub-projects will be adopted in the project, and how the projects will be governed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foundations can play another key role in a project&#8217;s evolution: defining the market dynamics around the project, including administration of the project trademark.
A trademark is one of an open source project&#8217;s most valuable resources for guaranteeing that vendors are distributing the project (or derivatives of it) in a way that does not damage the project&#8217;s reputation.
Open source projects commonly use trademark certification as a way to "bless" certain vendor products in the market or to influence the way derivative products behave.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects hold tightly to the idea that contributors are <em>individual contributors</em> and not representatives of companies for which they may happen to work.
In mature open source projects (like the Linux kernel), this allows people to maintain community status and seniority even when they change employers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_examples_of_open_source_project_governance_models">4.8. Examples of open source project governance models</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_do_ocracy">4.8.1. "Do-ocracy"</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source projects adopting the "do-ocracy" governance model tend to forgo formal and elaborate governance conventions and instead insist that "decisions are made by those who do the work." In other words: In a do-ocracy, members gain authority by making the most consistent contributions.
Peer review remains common under this model; however, individual contributors tend to retain de facto decision-making power over project components on which they&#8217;ve worked most closely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this reason, some do-ocracies will claim to have "no governance at all," relying instead on individual stakeholders' authority to make decisions on matters "where they&#8217;ve done the most work." But as we&#8217;ve already explained, such claims about an absence of governance are misguided.
Every open source project has a governance model.
In the case of most do-ocracies, the governance model is merely implicit in the everyday interactions of project members.
As a result, joining them can be difficult and intimidating for newcomers, as would-be contributors might not immediately know how to participate or seek approval for their contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Find an aspect of the project you feel you can improve and simply begin working.
Review the recorded history of changes to the project to identify the participants whose feedback will be integral to your successful contribution.
As the project accepts more of your contributions, you will gradually accrue influence in the community.
Do not expect to influence decisions in a do-ocracy until you are able to demonstrate a history of successful contribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_founder_leader">4.8.2. Founder-leader</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The founder-leader governance model is most common among new projects or those with a small number of contributors (and since most open source projects have only a small number of contributors, this is a rather popular model!).
In these projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project, establishes its vision, controls all permissions to merge code into it, and assumes the right to speak for it in public.
Some projects refer to their founder-leaders as "BDFLs" or "Benevolent Dictators for Life," a term that is falling out of fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In projects following the founder-leader model, lines of power and authority are typically quite clear; they radiate from founder-leaders, who are the final decision-makers for all project matters.
This model&#8217;s limitations become apparent as a project grows to a certain size.
Separating the founder-leaders' personal preferences from project design decisions eventually becomes difficult, and founder-leaders can become bottlenecks for project decision-making work.
In extreme cases, founder-leader models can create a kind of "caste" system in a project, as non-founders begin feeling like they&#8217;re unable to affect changes that aren&#8217;t in line with a founder&#8217;s vision.
Disagreements can lead to project splits.
Worse, a founder-leader&#8217;s disappearance, whether due to burnout or planned retirement, can cause a project to disintegrate entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Browse project mailing lists or discussion forums to identify the project&#8217;s founder-leaders, then address questions about participation and contribution to those leaders through one of the community&#8217;s public communication channels.
Founder-leaders tend to have a comprehensive view of the project&#8217;s needs and will direct you to areas of the project that will benefit most from your contribution.
Be sure to understand founder-leaders' vision for the project, as most founder-leaders will veto proposed changes they feel conflict with that vision.
When starting out, do not expect to propose changes that will not serve the founder-leaders' vision for the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_self_appointing_council_or_board">4.8.3. Self-appointing council or board</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recognizing shortcomings of the founder-leader model, the self-appointing council or board model aims to better facilitate community leadership turnover and succession.
Under this model, members of an open source project may appoint a number of leadership groups to govern various aspects of a project.
Such groups may have names like "steering committee," "committer council," "technical operating committee, "architecture council," or "board of directors." And typically, these groups construct their own decision-making conventions and succession procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The self-appointing council or board governance model is useful in cases where a project does not have a sponsoring foundation and establishing electoral mechanisms is prohibitively difficult.
But the model&#8217;s drawbacks become apparent when self-appointing governing groups grow insular and unrepresentative of the entire project community (as member-selection processes tend to spawn self-reinforcing leadership cultures).
Moreover, this model can stymie community participation in leadership activities, as community members often feel like they must "wait to be chosen" before they can take initiative on work that interests them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Because this governance model is typical of more mature open source projects, communities adopting this model will often curate getting started documentation aimed at assisting potential contributors.
Find this documentation and read it first.
Then read the project&#8217;s governance documentation to determine how its governing bodies are composed.
In many cases, you can locate a council or board governing the part of the project where you would like to make a contribution.
That body will be able to oversee your contribution and answer questions you may have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_electoral">4.8.4. Electoral</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some open source projects choose to conduct governance through elections.
They may hold elections for various roles, or conduct similar electoral processes to ratify or update project policies and procedures.
Under the electoral model, communities establish and document electoral procedures to which they all agree, then enact those procedures as a regular matter of decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This model is more common in larger open source projects where multiple qualified and interested contributors offer to play the same role.
Elections are also common for projects with a sponsor (a foundation, for example), because an electoral process can make the allocation of sponsor resources more transparent.
Electoral governance also tends to lead to precise documentation of project roles, procedures, and participation guidelines.
When election documents make these matters explicit, they help new contributors maximize their involvement in a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But elections also have drawbacks.
They can become contentious, distracting, and time-consuming for all project members (whether those members are running or not).
Some communities promote elections as a solution to the indefinite tenure of well-known project members; however, elections don&#8217;t generally cause turnover unless term limits are part of the project&#8217;s policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> Communities appointing leaders through elections typically feature election results and a leadership roster prominently on their project websites.
Review those documents to determine a point of contact in the project.
Well-governed open source communities will it make clear on their project websites their processes for proposing and reviewing items that the community can vote on.
As you establish a reputation for making useful contributions to the project, you may eventually decide to be a candidate for a project leadership position.
Be sure to interact productively and collaborate effectively with other contributors as they may be voting you into a leadership position some day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_single_vendor">4.8.5. Single-vendor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally, individual companies or industry consortia may choose to distribute software under the terms of an open source license as a way of reaching potential developers and users—even if they do not accept project contributions from those audiences.
They might do this to accelerate adoption of their work, spur development activity atop a software platform, support a plugin ecosystem, or avoid the overhead required for cultivating an external developer community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under this model, the governing organization usually does not accept contributions from anyone outside it.
Instead, open and closed source innovation occurs at the edges of the project, just where it contacts the rest of the world.
For this reason, some commentators call this the "walled garden" governance model.
Occasionally, projects following this model will adopt license with strong "copyleft" requirements, which they see as a deterrent to commercial competitors benefitting from their work on the project (the goal is to force competitors and customers with production requirements to purchase a non-open source license for the software—what some call a "dual-license" approach).
This model becomes problematic in cases where a project claims to have an open community but is in fact wholly owned by a company or consortium.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To get started in a project with this governance model:</strong> First, consider any existing relationship between your employer and the company originating the project, if applicable.
Next, assess the project&#8217;s licensing terms and review its change history and bug tracker to determine whether you are able to contribute to the aspect of the project that interests you—and in the way you would like.
Given the project&#8217;s particular licensing stipulations, you may find yourself working alongside or on top of a particular project rather than contributing to it directly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_foundation_backed">4.8.6. Foundation-backed</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To exert greater control over resources and project code, some open source projects choose to be managed by an incorporated NGO (non-government organization), such as a charitable nonprofit or trade association.
Doing this allows the "project," as an abstract entity, to take ownership of resources like servers, trademarks, patents, and insurance policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, foundation leadership and project leadership can form a single governance structure that manages all aspects of the open source project.
In other cases, the foundation manages some matters—such as trademarks and events—and other governance structures in the project(s) control other matters (such as code approval).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extensive funding and legal requirements normally limit this model to larger open source projects.
However, many smaller projects choose to join larger so-called umbrella foundations, such as the Software Freedom Conservancy or the Linux Foundation, to reap some of the benefits of this governance model.
This governance model is advantageous for projects seeking to establish legal relationships with third parties (like conference venues) or projects seeking to ensure successful leadership transitions following departure of key individuals.
It might also help prevent the commercialization of the project under a single vendor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High overhead—not strictly financial, but particularly in terms of contributor time, which can be substantial—is a significant drawback of the foundation-backed governance model.
Some foundations are incorporated as industry consortia, in which sponsoring companies govern the organization.
Different consortia allow different degrees of participation from individual project contributors; some are fairly open groups, while in others only corporate managers have authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get started in a project with this governance model: If a foundation does not govern day-to-day project contribution activity, then locate the project&#8217;s getting started documentation and follow it.
Otherwise, note that individual projects under a particular foundation&#8217;s umbrella will have their own sets of leaders, though some common guidelines may standardize basic contribution processes across all projects a foundation governs.
To identify a specific project&#8217;s leaders, consider addressing a request to the foundation members' mailing list.
You might also examine the project&#8217;s change history to identify frequent contributors and contact them.
As many foundations feature a contribution-based voting system, familiarize yourself with steps required to become a full voting member of the foundation.
If the foundation is a members-only industry consortium, determine whether your employer is already a member.
If not, talk to your manager about the importance of the project to your work and ask whether your employer might consider joining.
In either case, foundation projects may require signing contributor paperwork.
Your legal department should assist with reviewing and signing such paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="_conducting_basic_governance">4.9. Conducting basic governance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve discussed the nature and importance of open source project and community governance, factors that trigger evolutions in project governance models, and a few of the most popular open source governance models.
Finally, let&#8217;s examine some concrete steps you can take to structure your own community&#8217;s governance—whether you&#8217;re launching a new project or evolving one that&#8217;s already active.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that most governance models consist of two primary dimensions: roles, and policies and procedures.
The basic requirements here are actually quite spartan, and can be evolved as the project grows.
What follows constitutes a kind of <em>minimum viable product</em> for project governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In your project, each of the following sections could very well be its own document.
Or they might simply be part of a single long README—or anything in between.
What&#8217;s important it to get the basics of how things work down in text, so that people thinking about participating in your project know where to go, who to talk to, and most of all aren&#8217;t horribly surprised.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_importance_of_honesty">4.9.1. The importance of honesty</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing governance documentation, it can be tempting to define your project as you would like it to be—or how your corporate marketing department would like it to be seen—rather than how it actually is.
Particularly, project leaders frequently make the mistake of attempting to make the project appear more democratic than it actually is, in documentation.
This falls apart when users or contributors expect your project to live up to its governance documentation, and it doesn&#8217;t.
People who would have been fine with being told a project was single-company at the outset become very upset if they ask for their committer status and are refused later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like technical documentation, governance documentation should explain how things actually work.
If there are aspirational goals, those go in their own section under "Roadmap" or "TODO."</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_defining_roles">4.9.2. Defining roles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, your project will have a variety of real roles, but you only need to define a handful of them to start out.
 Those basic Roles are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>Member</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Contributor</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Leader</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you&#8217;ve thought about it, your project already features all these roles you already have in your project.
Each one of them should be recorded in a roles document of some kind, either in your project&#8217;s documentation or your main source code repository.
This allows you to make what was implicit into explicit, both setting expectations for and allowing more people to participate in your project.
For each role, you&#8217;ll need to define who they are, how they qualify for that role, what they are expected to do, and what their rights and privileges are.
Eventually you&#8217;ll go beyond these roles and define many more specific ones.
But detailing these three will take your project a fair distance on its journey.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_members">Members</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is possibly the least-documented role across all of open source, despite being the most pervasive.
Members are the people or organizations who participate in your project and are recognized for it.
Depending on how your project is run, these can be subscribers on a mailing list, sponsoring companies, known end-users, participants at an event, or members of a foundation.
In some projects, Member is synonymous with Contributor, but in most this is not the case.
Most projects have a much larger cadre of people who are involved with the project in some way but are not actively contributing code or content to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defining who Members are requires deciding who the project is actually serving, which is always a critical discussion to have.
Are customers of the main sponsoring company automatically project Members?
Can companies be Members, or only individuals?
Are end-users Members or can they only be Contributors?
More than anything, defining Members means defining who it is that project Leaders need to listen to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For almost all projects, you need to specify what rules Members are subject to (usually a code of conduct and not much else) and what they can expect from Leaders and Contributors.
It&#8217;s particularly helpful to explain how Members should participate in the project, such as "Members file bugs against this repository, and use the 'new bug' template."
Most people, given clear instructions, are happy to channel their participation into the routes you show them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In projects with democratically elected leadership, Members can be a much more rigorously defined role, because being a Member can come with voting rights.
This requires you to more carefully qualify Members to avoid vote-packing or simply derailing election procedures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_contributors">Contributors</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Far more projects have a written definition of Contributors, but fewer than you&#8217;d think.
It&#8217;s often assumed, in the age of publicly hosted source code control, that you count anyone in the GitHub or GitLab statistics as therefore a Contributor.
But defining "who is a Contributor to this project" can be deceptively hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is it anyone who posted on a mailing list, or do you need 100 merged pull requests?
Is it just code contributors, or contributors of any kind? What about folks who do events and advocacy?
Are staff who work for a contributing company automatically considered Contributors, or do they have to earn it individually?
What about someone who contributed a lot of code three years ago, but not since then?
Who gets listed in your release credits and how?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conversation around this will often have a greater effect on your project than the document does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Contributor role is also one for which you&#8217;ll need to set many more expectations for what Contributors receive in return for their work.
This not only includes an explanation of the intellectual property rules of the project (e.g., does the contributor still own their code or not), but also questions like how soon Contributor can expect their submissions to be reviewed and accepted or rejected.
Generally, you should also explain how the Contributor will be credited for their participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also a place where you set out clearly what rules Contributors need to follow.
For example, some projects require Contributors or their employers to sign paperwork officially sharing their copyright or other intellectual property (see below for more on this).
You may also require Contributors to do certain things to help maintain the project, such as review others' submissions or help with documentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_leaders">Leaders</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we noted, every project has leadership, even when those leaders are not clearly identified.
As such, at a minimum you&#8217;ll need to transparently identify who your Leaders are, so that decision-making processes can be clear.
Many projects also explain the qualifications and procedure to become a Leader, whether it&#8217;s selection by a committee, election, or simply based on your job.
If you have a more politically sophisticated project, then those should be written down in a selection/election procedure document as well (refer below), but if it&#8217;s simple, selection can just be part of the role document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What fewer projects put into their leadership role documents is the other parts: the powers and limitations of the Leaders, their duties, and how people leave the role (voluntary or not).
It&#8217;s very important that everyone know exactly how far a Leader&#8217;s authority extends, as well as what they&#8217;re responsible for, or you end up with a lot of conflict between Leaders and other project members.
Having a set of written duties helps immensely when your leadership team has to decide to remove a project Leader who has stopped participating, but does not want to resign.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project is trying to recruit new/additional Leaders, then it&#8217;s also important to have a detailed set of qualifications a Leader needs to meet.
Contrary to some expectations, having detailed qualifications gives people who want to move up in the project a target to shoot for.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_setting_policies_and_procedures">4.10. Setting policies and procedures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to some basic role documentation, there&#8217;s a certain amount of basic paperwork that each project should create for itself.
These <em>policy and procedure</em> (P&amp;P) documents are considered a kind of minimum for what you need in order to grow and mature a project.
Your project may, and eventually will, have other P&amp;P docs as your contributor base expands and the number of processes you need to write down with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these will be mostly technical (like release process, or a support policy), and we won&#8217;t be exploring those here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are three governance P&amp;P that every project should have:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Code of conduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribution process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication information</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects that grow larger and more popular, become commercially adopted, or are actively recruiting many new contributors probably want some additional P&amp;P documents, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Leadership selection/election process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributor promotion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security issue reporting and handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project trademark usage</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about these eight documents below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_developing_a_code_of_conduct">4.10.1. Developing a code of conduct</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a code of conduct (CoC) for your open source community is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to begin influencing the project&#8217;s governance model.
A code of conduct is a description of expectations for community members' behavior when they act within or on behalf of the project.
It might outline the values a community agrees to uphold, articulate the behaviors community members expect one another to exhibit in the service of those values, and identify the consequences of violating the code.
The most effective codes of conduct are those written through collaborative processes that involve participants across the community (not just project leadership!).
In this way, constructing a code of conduct can become a compelling community-building exercise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are the core items that every Code of Conduct needs to have:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A statement of what kind of behavior is encouraged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement of what kinds of behavior are prohibited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact information for reporting violations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the enforcement mechanism</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re starting out, both the report recipients and the enforcers of the CoC are likely to be your project founders.
As your project grows, you&#8217;ll want to form a specific CoC committee, but you don&#8217;t need that right away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_contribution_process">4.10.2. Contribution process</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to recruit contributors, you need to tell them the basics of how to contribute to your project.
For projects on GitHub or GitLab this is generally placed in a document called CONTRIBUTING.md, but it can really go anywhere as long as it&#8217;s linked from your project&#8217;s home page.
If you&#8217;ve documented your Contributor role, you can just use that for your contribution docs.
If you haven&#8217;t, then here&#8217;s a few things you should cover in your contribution document:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects have paperwork that needs to be submitted before any contributions can be accepted, such as a Developer Certificate or Origin (DCO) or Contributor License Agreement (CLA), certificate of identity, or GPG keyring.
Spell these out with step-by-step instructions in your contribution document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_communication_information">4.10.3. Communication information</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most open source projects have multiple ways that project members talk to each other, including email, chat, issues, code reviews, video conferencing, and even in-person meetings.
You need to spell out which channels your project uses, and how to join them.
It&#8217;s also important to keep this information up to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have them, it&#8217;s useful to list both your user forums as well as the channels used for contributors, so that people know where to take their questions.
Distinguish the media used for official project business as opposed to unofficial channels used for general discussion.
It&#8217;s extremely frustrating for contributors to be told "oh, we decided that on the mailing list" if they didn&#8217;t even know there was a mailing list.
Any regular meetings should link to a calendar, or at least information about the next meeting.
And if your community has any important events, such as annual developer conference, mention it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Refer to this guidebook&#8217;s chapter on communication norms in open source projects for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_leadership_selectionelection_process">4.10.4. Leadership selection/election process</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve already documented your "leadership" role, the information on how project members become leaders will be part of it.
However, some projects don&#8217;t get around to writing roles, and other projects have multi-step election procedures that require additional documentation.
Some just want a quick-reference of how the election or selection process works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have the typical new small project, this document will be very short indeed, containing simply the list of project leaders, who are also the project founders.
If your project has a self-appointing council, it&#8217;s not that much more complicated; just write down how the selection works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects that have full-blown elections will need a longer document containing all of the provisions of elections, including who gets to vote, how the vote is conducted and by whom, what the schedule is, and how candidates are selected.
We&#8217;ll offer additional advice on holding elections at the conclusion of this chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_contributor_promotion">4.10.5. Contributor promotion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project has multiple levels of contributor status, with a defined progression between them—what&#8217;s known as a "contributor ladder"—then it can be useful to write a specific document explaining how this works.
This will give new contributors an idea of what&#8217;s ahead of them and what they need to do to move up.
It also helps make sure that contributor promotion is being done fairly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For fairness, it&#8217;s preferable to make the promotion rules as objective as possible.
For example, "Has consistently helped with code reviews in the subproject" is good, but "Has completed at least 40 code reviews over the last 3 months in the subproject" is better.
Quantifiable rules help you avoid overlooking contributors who are valuable, but not outspoken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smaller projects, with only a couple of contributor levels (e.g., Contributor and Owner), do not need a separate document for this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_release_process">4.10.6. Release process</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Releasing software involves making decisions around what will and won&#8217;t be included in the current release.
When a project is small, this is pretty obvious, but in larger projects with contributors working for multiple employers, deciding what stays and what gets cut can be political.
Decisions about which platforms are supported can also be contentious.
As such, when your project grows you&#8217;re going to want to write down some process around releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects have defined release teams, in which case this document will be largely a collection of Role documents for the release team.
In other projects, the maintainers do the releases, but even with those it&#8217;s worthwhile to explain how they decide what gets included.
This doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily changing how you do releases, but rather just writing down what the real procedure already is, particularly the method of deciding which features and patches get left out.
The process for writing and editing the release announcement is also worthwhile, especially if your project involves multiple vendors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document will also have lots of non-governance content, like the locations of the servers, the commands to build packages, and how long to wait for mirrors to sync.
It&#8217;s expected that most of it will be technical instructions.
Just don&#8217;t neglect the <em>who</em> and <em>why</em> along with the <em>how</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_security_issue_reporting_and_handling">4.10.7. Security issue reporting and handling</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once your project&#8217;s code is being used in production by external users, managing security issue reports becomes a critical priority.
While this topic could use an entire chapter on its own, there is some basic governance setup associated with handling security issues.
This will include:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Who is selected to be on the security team, how, and when</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where security reports get sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How they are handled, including confidentiality requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What reciprocation security researchers can expect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long you can wait before disclosing</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Confidentiality requirements are particularly important for both the security team itself, and for the programmers and security researchers with whom you work.
For example, security researchers are willing to not disclose their findings to the public until your project does, but only if they are promised that your security team won&#8217;t do that either.
In many projects, security team members aren&#8217;t allowed to share certain information even with their own employers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_trademark_usage">4.10.8. Trademark usage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a project gets popular, both commercial and non-commercial groups want to use the project&#8217;s name, word mark, and graphical logo.
Whether it&#8217;s just statements of support, a third party wanting to sell shirts with your project on them, or other projects that derive from yours, projects need these entities to be following some kind of official policy around usage.
Even if the project has not filed for a trademark with any government yet, establishing a pattern of policy and permission will help protect your project&#8217;s name and marks in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such a policy consists of four things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A general statement of acceptable usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact information to request specific permission or for clarification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A designated team, committee, or contributor who is going to handle these requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional guidelines for the trademark team</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the actual acceptable usage statement and guidelines, projects should obtain legal assistance.
The governance part of this is selecting the "trademark team" (which could be an existing steering council, or similar), and how guidelines are updated and changed.
In projects run by multiple technology vendors, it&#8217;s critical to work this out in the early stages of the project, because the project&#8217;s own sponsors will want to use its mark almost immediately.
Make sure that responsibility here is shared between the stakeholders in your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like security issues, the trademark team needs to be able to handle confidential contacts, because sometimes pre-release startups may want to use your project name.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_holding_community_elections">4.11. Holding community elections</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As community projects grow, many choose to select community representatives.
This process may occur when a community loses a founder, a group decides to move to a "ruling technical council" governance model, or when a project moves to a non-profit governing body with paying members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the circumstances, many projects opt to select their community representatives through elections.
Historically, choosing a voting system, defining an electorate, and limiting the pool of eligible candidates has proven complicated for community projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section summarizes project election best practices, including who gets to vote, who can be a candidate, and how elections are run.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_electorate_and_eligible_candidate_pool">4.11.1. Electorate and eligible candidate pool</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Establishing franchise rules is critical.
Some projects have allowed anyone registered for a project&#8217;s site to vote in an election—a very low bar—but have specified that only project committers could be election candidates—a high bar.
However, almost all projects eventually broaden the pool of potential candidates to equal the pool of voters.
Anyone who can vote in the election is therefore eligible to become a candidate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects typically take one of three approaches to defining the electorate and candidate pools:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>High bar:</strong> Voters are members of an inside group—such as committers, maintainers, and core contributors.
Membership requires a long history of participation and seniority recognized by peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium bar:</strong> Active participants or foundation members can vote, as long as they meet a clearly articulated definition of participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low bar:</strong> Anyone can vote as long as they complete some basic steps, like signing up to the program or joining the mailing list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defining an activity metric and minimum bar specifying what qualifies as "participation" can become contentious, mainly because it involves drawing arbitrary lines delimiting eligible participants.
Generally, projects specify that quantified, ongoing participation is necessary to become part of the electorate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One common election fear is ballot stuffing or cohort effects, where large companies dominate the representative bodies by having a large voting bloc, or where friends of candidates will pass the low bar to become voters simply to vote for their candidate.
In most cases, however, such fears are unfounded.
Technical communities often try to create rules to mitigate against possible abuses of the system, but in most cases, these rules are "premature optimization," which Donald Knuth, author of <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>, has famously described as "the root of all evil." <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup> Avoiding special rules—and addressing issues with the electoral process as they arise—is generally the better practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final consideration is the process for becoming a candidate in the election.
The most popular option is self-nomination, where candidates post election information and their reasons for running.
Another option is nomination, which is often the same as self-nomination as the candidate typically asks people to nominate them and second their nomination.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_voting_system">4.11.2. Voting system</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another complex community decision is the voting system.
Any community will include people passionate about how to vote—and how to count votes.
Without proper care, conversations about these issues can go on for months and result in proposals that are almost impossible to implement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most community projects have used:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Voting by secret ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online voting, with a personal token to ensure each person may only vote once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some form of preferential voting, listing candidates in order of preference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single transferable vote</a> (STV) to count the votes and identify winners</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some projects continue to use alternative voting systems like "first past the post" or weighted voting systems, in which voters receive 12 tokens to allocate to candidates however they wish, and the candidates with the most tokens win the election.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several projects use online counting software.
Options to consider include:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><a href="http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/">Condorcet Internet Voting Service</a>, a free, online voting and Condorcet counting system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.opavote.com/">OpaVote</a> (formerly OpenSTV), a commercial election counting Software-as-a-Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/openstv">OpenSTV</a>, formerly available under the General Public License (GPL) and still used by several projects to count elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/">Helios</a>, another free election service that allows online voting and several different vote counting methods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_how_to_start">4.11.3. How to start</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are planning to propose an election system, begin with a mission statement.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to ensure the technical steering committee represents everyone contributing actively to the project, valuing non-code contributions equally to code contributions, in the definition of the technical scope and direction of the project.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mission statement clarifies several things: who is being represented by the elected body, what their authority will be, and why they are being elected.
Once you have agreed on the goal of the elected body, choose the simplest ways to define membership in the body being represented.
Then, choose the simplest voting and counting system possible.</p>
